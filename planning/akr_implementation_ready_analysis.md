# AKR Documentation Governance — Implementation-Ready Analysis
## Definitive Synthesis: Five Reviews + Module-Based Architecture | March 2026

**Engineering Standards | Confidential | Ready for Implementation Planning**

---

## About This Document

This is the definitive pre-implementation analysis for the AKR Documentation Governance system. It synthesizes five independent reviews and one architectural clarification that materially changed the implementation scope. It is structured to feed directly into an implementation plan — every section ends with a concrete, actionable consequence.

### Source Material

| Source | Access | Key Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Review 1 — Claude | No repository access | Structural governance; pre-pilot assumptions; version drift risk; Phase 3 infrastructure gap |
| Review 2 — GitHub Copilot Round 1 | Direct repo inspection | Monolith diagnosis confirmed; Copilot coding agent as Phase 2.5; first context saturation identification |
| Review 3 — GitHub Copilot Round 2 | Deeper inspection | Charter sizes quantified; compression elevated to blocking precondition; test infrastructure as migration asset; `force_workflow_bypass` corrected |
| Review 4 — M365 Copilot | README + documentation | Agent Skills as primary workflow primitive; Copilot Studio for non-developer HITL; premium request metering; `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` retention |
| Review 5 — GitHub Copilot (Module Architecture) | Direct repo + module clarification | Three-tier documentation hierarchy defined; two-mode Agent Skill specified; `modules.yaml` full schema; `validate_documentation.py` scope upgraded; `layer` vs. `project_type` distinction corrected |
| Review 6 — GitHub Copilot (Schema Audit) | Full inspection of `akr-config-schema.json` + `consolidation-config-schema.json` | Four corrections: `modules-schema.json` is a new artifact; `consolidation-config-schema.json` needs `modulesManifestPath`; dual cross-repo config overlap; `project_type` not in existing `requiredTags`. Three additions: `humanInput` schema maps to HITL model; `warnOnMissingLayers` already defined; `monitoring` schema feeds cost baseline |
| Review 7 — GitHub Copilot (Final File Inspection) | Direct read of `copilot-instructions.md`, `.akr/workflows/`, `tag-registry.json` | Confirmed `copilot-instructions.md` is a full replacement (not partial edit); confirmed two existing workflows (`validate-documentation.yml` already calls the script); confirmed `tag-registry.json` PascalCase format incompatible with free-text `feature` field examples |
| Module Architecture Clarification | Owner-provided | `courses_service_doc.md` confirmed as Level 1 spec; module grouping rules; database object separation; template adaptation requirements |
| Workflow Clarifications (Owner-provided) | Owner-provided | `/docs.interview` original purpose clarified as HITL completion for `❓` sections in existing docs; Agent Skill Mode C added for interactive HITL; zero-cloud/no-incremental-cost constraint made explicit; original `core-akr-templates` ↔ `akr-mcp-server` design intent documented |
| Review 10 — GitHub Copilot (Pilot Manifest Simplification) | Direct repo + pilot manifest inspection | Confirmed training-tracker-backend testing supports a lean `modules.yaml` schema (`name`, `grouping_status`, `doc_output`, `files` only), removed `modules-yaml-status` metadata header field as non-value traceability, and retained `status: draft` as the default generated-document maturity state |
| Review 9 — Skill Optimization Analysis | Post-implementation planning conversation | Three failure modes of Copilot skill non-invocation identified; three-layer reliability stack specified (`disable-model-invocation` frontmatter + session hooks + in-document metadata contract); LLM execution quality variance quantified (Claude Sonnet 4.6 ≥90% vs. GPT-4o ~75%); eval framework and `benchmark.json` schema defined; `SKILL-COMPAT.md` as companion model compatibility matrix introduced; hooks (`postToolUse` + `agentStop`) specified as Layer 2 enforcement |
| CL 41 — Architectural Review (Review 11) | review/ folder inspection + direct file comparison against production files | Architecture tension confirmed: local copy proliferation vs. remote-source model. Three confirmed fixes: (1) vale rules distributed redundantly — stop distribution, fetch at CI runtime from `.akr/vale-rules/` only; (2) SKILL.md monolith token waste — v1.1.0 dispatcher architecture with on-demand mode scripts (65–77% token savings for groupings/resolve modes); (3) `copilot-instructions.md` overwritten by distribution — explicitly excluded from `distribute-skill.yml`. New bug found: vale working-directory path resolution error in `review/validate-documentation.yml` (`cd ~/.akr/templates` + workspace-relative `$DOC_FILES`). New guidance gap: custom vale rule handling ambiguous in Migration Guide Step 2. Submodule removal recommended in favor of runtime clone (CI already uses this pattern). |

## Part 1: The Foundational Architecture — What We Are Building

Before implementation details, the architecture must be stated precisely. All prior confusion about what a "module" is, what templates apply where, and what the agent does vs. what humans validate is resolved here.

**The key architectural insight confirmed by the module clarification:** The `courses_service_doc.md` sample already *is* the correct Level 1 output. It covers `CoursesController`, `ICourseService`, `ICourseRepository`, `EfCourseRepository`, and `CourseDtos` in a single document — not because it was manually crafted to be comprehensive, but because the module grouping principle correctly identifies these five files as one logical domain unit. The sample is the acceptance criterion for Level 1 template adaptation.

### 1.2 The Module Grouping Principle

A module is a **logical grouping of source files that together implement a single domain concept**, identified by:

- **Namespace / folder co-location** sharing the same domain noun (e.g., `Course`)
- **Dependency graph** — controller injects service interface; service injects repository interface; EF implementation implements repository interface
- **DTO / Contract alignment** — DTOs serve the same domain noun as the service
- **Interface / implementation pairs** — `ICourseService.cs` + `CourseService.cs`

**Rules that are invariant:**

| Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `max_files: 8` per module | Context token ceiling with condensed charter (~2,500 tokens) + source files |
| Database objects are never grouped with application code | Different template, different documentation unit, different Level |
| One `modules.yaml` per repository | Single manifest; `validate_documentation.py` and `consolidate.py` both read from it |
| `modules[]` for API/UI groupings; `database_objects[]` for DB objects | Schema enforces the separation; validator applies different section rules per type |
| Mode A (grouping proposal) must precede Mode B (documentation generation) | Cannot generate a module doc before the grouping is human-validated |

### 1.3 What the Agent Does vs. What Humans Validate

| Stage | Who/What | What They Do | Time Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mode A — Grouping proposal | Copilot coding agent | Scans project; groups by domain noun; writes draft `modules.yaml`; opens PR | Automated |
| Mode A — Grouping validation | Developer who knows the codebase | Reviews groupings; reassigns misplaced files; names modules correctly; splits over-large groups | 5–10 min per project |
| Mode A — Draft manifest review | Copilot agent | Writes draft `modules.yaml`, summarizes the proposed boundaries in chat, and stops for direct human review of the manifest in VS Code. | <1 min (agent) |
| Mode A — Manifest validation | Developer who knows the codebase | Opens `modules.yaml` in VS Code, corrects groupings directly, validates naming and file placement, and sets `grouping_status` based on assessment. | 5–10 min |
| Mode A — Incremental update (new/changed file) | Copilot agent + developer | Agent reads the current `modules.yaml`, proposes only the affected module entry changes in chat, and patches the manifest directly on confirmation. | ≤5 min |
| Mode B — Documentation generation | Copilot coding agent | Reads a grouping-approved `modules.yaml`; loads condensed charter; reads source files; generates a draft module document; opens draft PR | Automated |
| Mode B — Pre-commit draft (committed) | Copilot agent | Before writing to doc_output, generates draft at `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` and displays validation summary in chat. Developer edits draft in VS Code. Agent writes final doc from confirmed draft. Draft is a permanent committed artifact. | <1 min (agent); no `modules-yaml-status` field is written into the metadata header |
| Mode B — In-editor content review | Developer + tech lead | Opens draft in VS Code Markdown Preview. Fills ❓ sections, validates business rules, confirms architecture, and reviews document maturity independently from module grouping approval. Replies 'ready to commit'. | 20–30 min |
| Mode B — Incremental update (code change) | Copilot agent + developer | Agent reads committed draft; reads only changed source files; loads only relevant charter sections; patches affected sections. Developer confirms targeted changes only. Does not re-read all files or re-run full SSG unless patch scope expands. | ≤10 min |
| Mode B — Content review | Developer + tech lead | Fills `❓` sections; validates business rules; confirms data operations accuracy; determines whether the document remains draft or is promoted through a separate content-approval decision | 20–30 min per module |
| Mode C — Interactive HITL completion | Copilot agent mode + developer | Guides developer through unresolved `❓` one section at a time in existing documents; records accepted edits and deferred items | 10–20 min per document |
| CI gate | `validate_documentation.py` + Vale | Validates required sections, markers, `project_type`, `feature_tag` format | Automated at PR merge |

Governance clarification: the module `grouping_status` recorded in `modules.yaml` is the approval state for the module boundary produced by Mode A. It authorizes Mode B to run, but it does not certify the generated document content. A generated module document therefore begins life as a draft artifact unless document-content approval is separately completed and explicitly recorded.

Critical assessment: a separate Mode A review sheet duplicates the exact boundary decision that already lives in `modules.yaml`, but without becoming the authoritative input to Mode B or CI. That duplication adds a second mutable artifact, creates drift risk between the review sheet and the manifest, and weakens ownership by forcing a technical lead to reconcile two representations of the same approval. For initial module grouping, the real governance object is `modules.yaml`; review should happen directly there. The committed draft remains justified in Mode B because it captures generated narrative and unresolved content that do not otherwise exist in source form.

This is the correct HITL model: **validate the grouping** (Mode A), **generate draft module content and review that content** (Mode B), then **interactively resolve remaining `❓` markers in the editor** (Mode C) before merge. Grouping approval and document-content approval are separate governance decisions and must not share a single ambiguous status value.

## Part 2: Repository Ground Truth — Confirmed Facts

*All code-level findings are from direct repository inspection (Reviews 2, 3, 5). These supersede document-level claims.*

### 2.1 `akr-mcp-server` — Final Verdict

**Archive at current state (v0.2.0). Do not invest in Sprint 2.**

Evidence summary:
- `src/server.py`: 75,082 bytes, ~1,750 lines, single `if/elif` dispatcher (lines 815–1,507)
- Duplicate `except TypeError` at lines 1,468–1,498 — active undocumented bug
- `tests/test_server.py`: 67 lines, 100% `@pytest.mark.skip` — zero server-layer test coverage
- `VSCODE_WORKSPACE_FOLDER` hard dependency (line 1,028) + `setup.ps1` (14,849 bytes Windows PowerShell) — Windows + VS Code by design
- Version drift: `InitializationOptions` reports `0.1.0`; tool handlers report `0.2.0`
- `force_workflow_bypass` is config-gated via `allowWorkflowBypass` — not ungated as earlier reviews stated
- Zero team adoption — zero migration cost

**What to carry forward (do not discard):**
- `validation_library.py` — standalone validation logic, CI-reusable
- `test_pipeline_e2e.py` + `ServiceTemplateContext`/`ComponentTemplateContext` type definitions — Phase 2.5 acceptance criteria
- `generate_lean_backend_doc` MCP Prompt pattern (lines 1,550–1,700) — the pre-loading approach is the reference design for the condensed charter + Agent Skill architecture
- Tool-layer tests: `test_context_builder.py`, `test_validation_library.py`, `test_workflow_enforcement.py` — define the quality bar for generated documentation

**M365 analysis conflict resolved:** The M365 recommendation to "complete Sprint 2 first" was based on README-only analysis. Repository-grounded evidence overrules it. Archive immediately.

### 2.1A Original Design Intent: `core-akr-templates` and `akr-mcp-server` Relationship

The historical relationship between the two repositories was under-documented and should be explicit for decision traceability.

- `core-akr-templates` was intended as the remote canonical standards source on GitHub, not as a local developer dependency.
- The original PoC flow was: `core-akr-templates` (remote authority) → startup/CI sync pull → local `akr-mcp-server` context → slash-command workflow in VS Code.
- That sync mechanism was a planned Sprint 2 deliverable and was never implemented, so the repositories never became operationally connected in production.
- The Hosted MCP Context Source model replaces exactly this planned-but-unbuilt sync layer while preserving the same architectural intent (centralized remote standards, local authoring workflow).

**Consequence:** The current strategy is architectural continuity, not architectural reversal. The intermediary changed; the source-of-truth model did not.

### 2.1B Canonical Validator Ownership and CI Fallback Clarification

To avoid recurring confusion in governance assessments, validator ownership is explicit:

- The canonical script is `core-akr-templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`.
- Any copy under `akr-mcp-server/scripts/validation/` is legacy-only and must not be treated as an active dependency in end-state architecture decisions.
- Application-repo workflows should resolve validator execution from `core-akr-templates` first (submodule/local clone path), then use raw-download fallback.
- Raw fallback URLs must track the `core-akr-templates` default branch (currently `master`) or use a pinned release ref. Hardcoding `main` for this repository creates a latent 404 path under degraded fallback conditions.

**Consequence:** Governance maturity and merge-gate readiness must be assessed against `core-akr-templates` assets and workflow behavior, not legacy `akr-mcp-server` script copies.

### 2.1C PR Template Handling for Onboarding Repositories

> **Decision: CONFIRMED** (2026-04-02). The recommended distribution model and optimal onboarding implementation steps below have been reviewed and agreed. See `PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md` Deliverable 2B for concrete implementation tasks, workflow YAML sketch, output locations, and acceptance criteria.

The file `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` is a governance artifact and should be sourced from `core-akr-templates`, not authored independently in each application repository. This pattern applies to any future one-time onboarding scaffolds defined for `core-akr-templates` (for example: CODEOWNERS baseline snippets, onboarding checklist seeds, or optional `modules.yaml` scaffolds).

**Confirmed distribution model:**

- Keep a canonical copy in `core-akr-templates` (single source of truth).
- Distribute via a dedicated onboarding-only workflow (`distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml`) rather than extending the recurring `distribute-skill.yml`.
- Use `distribute-skill.yml` only for high-frequency artifacts (SKILL, compatibility guidance, hooks, and shared validator/lint governance assets).
- Re-runs of the onboarding bundle workflow are manual/on-demand (`workflow_dispatch` only), not tag-triggered.

Why this split is preferred:

- Reduces unnecessary PR noise in already-onboarded repos when recurring artifacts change.
- Avoids coupling one-time onboarding scaffolds with frequent skill release cadence.
- Keeps ownership clear: **onboarding bundle** (one-time scaffolds) vs. **operational skill bundle** (recurring updates).
- Allows targeted re-onboarding (governance baseline refresh) without triggering a skill update across all registered repos.

Confirmed implementation steps (see Deliverable 2B in `PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md` for full task breakdown):

1. Add canonical template file to `core-akr-templates` under `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md`.
2. Create `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` in `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/` with `workflow_dispatch` trigger and per-repo targeting.
3. Sync onboarding bundle artifacts in one PR per target repo: PR template, CODEOWNERS baseline snippet, optional `modules.yaml` seed.
4. Add post-sync verification step in workflow summary: file-presence check, branch protection reminder, required CODEOWNERS paths listed.
5. Keep re-runs manual only. New repos trigger a fresh dispatch; governance baseline refreshes may trigger targeted re-dispatch without affecting already-current repos.

**Consequence:** This preserves strict governance consistency while keeping routine distribution lean and reducing maintenance churn across onboarded repositories. Any future one-time governance scaffold defined in `core-akr-templates` follows the same pattern: add to the onboarding bundle, not to `distribute-skill.yml`.

Implementation status (2026-04-02):

- Canonical PR template source directory established: `core-akr-templates/.github/pull_request_template/`.
- Onboarding seed source directory established: `core-akr-templates/examples/onboarding/`.
- Onboarding distribution workflow added: `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml`.
- Seed artifacts added under `examples/onboarding/`: `CODEOWNERS.baseline`, `modules.yaml.seed`.

### 2.2 `core-akr-templates` — Asset Inventory

**Templates — 10 confirmed (strategy documents referenced 8):**

| Template | Size | Role in New Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| `lean_baseline_service_template.md` | 28,029 bytes | Level 1 base — needs module variant adaptation |
| `ui_component_template.md` | 25,455 bytes | Level 1 base for UI modules — needs module variant |
| `table_doc_template.md` | 6,700 bytes | Level 2 — use as-is for database tables |
| `embedded_database_template.md` | 16,515 bytes | Level 2 — use as-is for embedded DB services |
| `feature-consolidated.md` | 7,204 bytes | Level 3 — already designed for consolidation; `FOR_EACH_*` placeholder syntax is `consolidate.py`'s data contract |
| `feature-testing-consolidated.md` | 11,729 bytes | Level 3 testing variant — parallel output for QA |
| `comprehensive_service_template.md` | 41,880 bytes | Reference only — too large for active context |
| `standard_service_template.md` | 20,608 bytes | Consolidate into lean_baseline via tier validation |
| `legacy_inventory_template.md` | 9,897 bytes | Retain for legacy system documentation |
| `minimal_service_template.md` | 3,620 bytes | Consolidate into lean_baseline via tier validation |

**Charters — confirmed sizes and token loads:**

| Charter | Size | Tokens | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` | 44,629 bytes | ~11,000 | Source for backend condensed charter |
| `AKR_CHARTER_UI.md` | 41,057 bytes | ~10,200 | Source for UI condensed charter |
| `AKR_CHARTER.md` (General) | 25,652 bytes | ~6,400 | Source for general condensed charter |
| `AKR_CHARTER_DB.md` | ~18,000 bytes | ~4,500 | Source for DB condensed charter |

**Context saturation is guaranteed for backend modules without charter compression.** Backend charter (~11,000) + lean baseline template (~7,000) = ~18,000 tokens before any source file loads. Charter compression is a Phase 0 blocking precondition.

**Other confirmed assets:**
- `standards/copilot-instructions.md` — exists; template selection logic is file-centric (must be rewritten to module-centric)
- `.akr/vale-rules/` — 7+ rule files; `RequiredSections.yml` confirms Vale checks for required sections; migration to `validation/vale-rules/` is non-trivial
- `.akr/workflows/` — workflow definitions already exist; audit before rebuilding
- `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` (9,029 bytes) — retain as version registry for skill-template coupling; deprecate all other roles
- `tag-registry.json` — `feature` field in `modules.yaml` must match an approved entry here
- `akr-config-schema.json` — `layer` enum: `["UI", "API", "Database", "Integration", "Infrastructure", "Full-Stack"]` — used at project level in `modules.yaml`
- `consolidation-config-schema.json` — cross-repository configuration contract for `consolidate.py`; valid for repo-level config; document-to-section mapping must account for module docs as atomic units

**Additional assets (newly confirmed):**
- `tag-registry-schema.json` (3,847 bytes) — JSON Schema for `tag-registry.json` validation; enforces structure for feature enumeration
- `COST_MONITORING.md` (8,296 bytes) — GitHub Actions cost baseline and tracking guidance; references Jan 2026 pricing model ($0.005/min Ubuntu); critical for Phase 0 budgeting
- `workflows/distribute-tag-registry.yml` — Automation for syncing tag-registry across repositories
- `workflows/validate-documentation.yml` — CI pipeline for documentation validation; calls `validate_documentation.py`
- `vale-rules/AKR/` — Nested directory structure with organization-specific Vale quality rules (path different from earlier `vale-rules/` reference; no migration needed)

## Part 3: The Context Window Saturation Problem — Definitively Resolved

### The Scale of the Problem

| Context Load | Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` (current) | ~11,000 | Exceeds working context alone for structured output |
| + `lean_baseline_service_template.md` | + ~7,000 | **~18,000 tokens before source files load** |
| + 5 source files (typical module) | + ~5,000–8,000 | **~23,000–26,000 tokens** — guaranteed degradation |
| + 10 source files (large module) | + ~12,000–15,000 | **~30,000–33,000 tokens** — guaranteed failure |

This is not a risk to test. It is a guaranteed failure mode under current charter sizes for every backend module. Charter compression must precede all other Phase 0 work.

### The Four-Layer Resolution (Confirmed Across All Reviews)

**Layer 1 — Charter Compression (Phase 0, blocking)**

Produce condensed "dense summary" versions of each charter. Target: ~2,500 tokens each.

What the condensed charter retains:
- All required section headings and minimum content criteria
- Required YAML front matter fields (`feature`, `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, `compliance_mode`), where `status` represents document maturity and must not be inferred from `modules.yaml` grouping approval alone
- `🤖` / `❓` / `NEEDS` / `VERIFY` / `DEFERRED` marker syntax and placement rules
- Quality thresholds (minimum word counts, required structural elements)
- Module-level section requirements (Module Files header, Operations Map, full-stack architecture diagram)
- Cross-references to full charter for deep reference

What gets removed: explanatory prose, rationale text, worked examples, historical context. Full charters stay in `charters/` as reference documentation.

With compressed charters:

| Module Type | Charter | Instructions | Source Files | Total | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Typical backend (5 files) | ~2,500 | ~1,500 | ~6,000 | **~10,000** | Comfortable |
| Typical UI (5 files) | ~2,500 | ~1,500 | ~5,000 | **~9,000** | Comfortable |
| Large backend (8 files) | ~2,500 | ~1,500 | ~10,000 | **~14,000** | Workable |
| Max module (8 files, large) | ~2,500 | ~1,500 | ~14,000 | **~18,000** | Stress-test boundary |

**Layer 2 — `max_files: 8` Governance Constraint**

Enforced by the `modules.yaml` `files` array ceiling and corresponding schema validation. `validate_documentation.py` fails validation if a module lists more than 8 files. Modules exceeding 8 files must be split by the developer during Mode A validation. This bounds the worst-case token load by governance design.

**Layer 3 — Agent Skills for On-Demand Charter Loading**

Agent Skills load contextually, not as a monolithic pre-load. The condensed charter is queried in Step 2 of Mode B — after `modules.yaml` has been read and `project_type` has been inferred from the module file set. This means the charter is loaded only when needed, in the correct variant, rather than loading all charters as ambient context.

**Layer 4 — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as Fallback**

If hosted MCP context source configuration (Assumption 2) fails, the condensed charter (~3,000–4,000 characters) fits within `.github/copilot-instructions.md`'s practical limit. This is simultaneously the Assumption 2 fallback and the primary delivery mechanism for teams that do not configure hosted MCP context sources.

**Committed draft as update-scenario context anchor:**

The value of the pre-commit draft is fully realized when it is committed as a permanent artifact and used as the starting context for all subsequent Mode B runs on that module. The first-run benefit (loading a single markdown file instead of re-reading all source files to incorporate developer edits) is real but modest. The update-run benefit is the primary economic argument.

For the update scenario - the most common Mode B invocation after initial onboarding - the difference is significant:

| Context load | Tokens (typical 6-file api-backend module) |
|---|---|
| Full Mode B re-generation (current) | Condensed charter (~2,500) + 6 source files (~6,000) = ~8,500 |
| Incremental update via committed draft | Committed draft (~3,000) + 1 changed source file (~800) + targeted charter section (~400) = ~4,200 |

The incremental path reduces per-update context load by approximately 50% for a mid-size module. An 8-file module at the `max_files` ceiling benefits proportionally more - exactly the scenario where context economics matter most.

The committed draft also changes what SSG Pass 2 means in the update context. Pass 2 is the most expensive pass - it loads all source files. In incremental-update mode, Pass 2 is replaced by a targeted read of only the changed files. The committed draft provides the established context for all unchanged sections. This is forward payload discipline extended to the update scenario: carry what was validated forward; re-generate only what changed.

**Staleness governance:** A committed draft that is not updated after code changes can mislead future agents. Two mitigations: (1) `last_reviewed_at` field in modules.yaml updated by the agent on every Mode B run; (2) v1.1 `--check-sync` validator flag compares `last_reviewed_at` against `git log` dates on module source files and emits WARNING when the draft is stale. For v1.0, document that committed drafts older than the most recent code change are advisory, not authoritative.

## Part 3A: Separation of Concerns for Context Optimization

### Why this separation is required

Pilot assets currently repeat the same requirements across four surfaces: full charters, module templates, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `SKILL.md` workflow steps. The repeated content causes three concrete failures:

1. **Token waste in every Mode B run** because the model re-reads equivalent constraints from multiple files.
2. **Conflict drift** when one file updates and another copy of the rule remains stale.
3. **Ambiguous enforcement ownership** where teams cannot tell whether a failure should be fixed in template shape, workflow sequencing, or policy constraints.

The solution is strict ownership by function: **why (charter), what (copilot instructions), shape (template), and when/how (skill steps)**.

### Definitive ownership model

| Artifact | Primary Purpose | Must Contain | Must Not Contain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full Charter (`.akr/charters/*.md`) | Governance rationale and policy intent | Principles, rationale, tradeoffs, decision history, examples for human understanding | Runtime generation steps, duplicated marker syntax blocks, repeated section checklists already enforced elsewhere |
| Condensed Copilot Instructions (`copilot-instructions/*.instructions.md` and fallback `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) | Runtime constraints loaded into model context | Required front matter keys, marker policy, required section constraints, exclusions, minimum quality gates | Pass-by-pass workflow orchestration, long rationale prose, large examples |
| Module Templates (`templates/*_module*.md`) | Output document shape | Section order, headings, table schemas, placeholders | Policy explanations, workflow instructions, repeated rule definitions that belong to copilot instructions |
| Skill Workflow (`.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md`) | Execution sequence and HITL gates | Mode A/B/C steps, branching logic, approval stops, artifact paths, metadata write steps | Duplicated policy/rule semantics that already live in copilot instructions |

### Rationale by artifact

- **Charter -> rationale only**: charters are the authoritative source of intent and evolution. They are read by humans and reviewers, not optimized as active generation context. Moving operational constraints out of charter reduces context pressure without losing governance traceability.
- **Copilot instructions -> constraints only**: this is the highest-frequency runtime context. It must be compact and deterministic so every run gets one unambiguous set of rules.
- **Templates -> shape only**: template inflation directly increases generation tokens. Keeping only document skeleton and placeholders minimizes context and avoids conflicting prose guidance.
- **SKILL.md -> sequence only**: step files should govern orchestration and approval flow. If policy rules are duplicated in SKILL.md, both policy and sequence drift together and become hard to validate.

### Recommended normalization changes

#### A. Charter updates

- Keep universal principles and backend rationale in full charter files.
- Replace repeated operational blocks with short references to condensed instructions and validator enforcement points.
- Add a one-line note in each charter: "Reference document for governance intent; runtime constraints are enforced via copilot instructions and validator."

#### B. Template updates

- Remove explanatory policy prose from templates (for example marker semantics and rule-format explanations).
- Keep only section scaffolds, tables, and placeholder markers (`🤖`, `❓`) where needed for authoring flow.
- Ensure module templates remain strictly structural so they can be reused across models without policy drift.

#### C. Copilot instructions updates

- Consolidate all runtime constraints into one concise contract per project type.
- Keep: front matter fields, marker rules, mandatory sections, exclusions, and completeness thresholds.
- Remove: pass sequencing and mode orchestration details (owned by `SKILL.md`).

#### D. SKILL.md updates

- Retain only workflow sequencing and approval gating for Mode A/B/C.
- Replace duplicated marker/quality policy text with explicit reference to copilot instruction contract.
- Keep metadata header write requirements and committed artifact checkpoints as workflow obligations.

### Expected measurable outcomes

| Outcome | Baseline Risk | Post-normalization Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| Context load per Mode B run | Elevated by repeated policy text | Lower token load due to single-copy constraints |
| Rule drift across artifacts | High when updates are partial | Reduced through single-owner rule placement |
| Debugging governance failures | Ambiguous root cause | Faster triage by artifact ownership (policy vs workflow vs shape) |
| Pilot onboarding clarity | Mixed due to overlap | Clear where to edit for each change type |

### Implementation consequence

Phase 2 should include a targeted "artifact normalization" workstream that updates all four surfaces in one coordinated pass, then validates parity with pilot repos through distribution workflow and CI checks.

### Addendum 1: Charter Normalization Scope — Line-Level Removal Table for AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md

| Charter Section | Lines | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service Naming Conventions | 73–177 | **Retain** — governance rationale for naming | Not duplicated in instructions |
| Service Documentation Structure (Tiers 1–3) | 179–275 | **Retain** — rationale for section tiers | Informs editorial decisions |
| Service Documentation Patterns — Business Rules Format | 280–313 | **Retain header/rationale only; remove worked example** | Table schema duplicated in `backend-service.instructions.md §Business Rules Requirements` |
| Flow Diagrams — Template + Real Example | 316–384 | **Remove both code blocks; retain "why text-based" rationale** | Duplicates template shape already in `lean_baseline_service_template_module.md` |
| Dependencies/Consumers Documentation — full tables with examples | 387–425 | **Remove example tables; retain column descriptions only** | Schema duplicated in instructions §Module Files Rules |
| Data Operations Documentation — full tables with examples | 428–466 | **Remove example tables; retain rationale paragraph** | Schema duplicated in instructions §Data Operations Requirements |
| Enterprise Best Practices §1–7 (entire section, lines 469–935) | 469–935 | **Move to a new file: `docs/patterns/backend-best-practices.md`** | ~466 lines of C# code samples — this is the primary source of the ~8,500-token excess |
| AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow | 939–1016 | **Remove** — superseded by SKILL.md workflow | Copilot prompt in lines 962–997 conflicts with SKILL.md Mode B step 2 routing |
| Cross-Repository Integration | 1019–1064 | **Retain** — governance for cross-repo linking not duplicated elsewhere | |
| Common Anti-Patterns (lines 1068–1290) | 1068–1290 | **Move to `docs/patterns/backend-best-practices.md`** | ~222 more lines of C# code — not a generation-time artifact |
| Maintenance and Evolution | 1293–1335 | **Retain** — governance intent for update cadence | |
| Quick Reference (Copilot Steps) | 1339–1366 | **Remove** — superseded by SKILL.md Mode B workflow | |

**Net effect:** Charter reduces from ~1,366 lines (~11,000 tokens) to approximately 350–400 lines (~2,800 tokens). A new `backend-best-practices.md` file receives the code examples for human reference — not removed from the repo, just decoupled from the generation-time load path.

Add the one-line handoff note to the charter `## Purpose` section:
> `"Reference document for governance intent; runtime constraints enforced via copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md and validate_documentation.py. This document is the rationale reference only."`

### Addendum 2: Template Normalization Scope — Line-Level Removal Table for lean_baseline_service_template_module.md

| Template Element | Lines | Action | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Module Grouping Principle prose block | 44–50 | **Remove entirely** | Governed by SKILL.md Mode A step 3–4; duplication is a drift vector |
| `Capabilities` section example bullets | 67–71 | **Remove example** | Placeholder examples inflate context; developer sees output from Mode B, not template |
| `Not Responsible For` example bullets | 78–82 | **Remove example** | Same reason |
| `File Interaction Pattern` static prose | 217–222 | **Remove** | This is a pattern description, not a structural placeholder; belongs in charter |
| `Common Questions` sub-bullets in Business Rules | 241–243 | **Remove** | Redundant with marker policy; ❓ marker already instructs same behavior |
| `Expected vs Unexpected Failures` static prose | 392–401 | **Remove** | Static how-to prose in a generation template; belongs in charter or patterns doc |
| `Template Metadata` footer (entire section) | 459–471 | **Remove entirely** | Authoring guidance — belongs in `README.md` or onboarding doc, not a generation artifact |

**Net effect:** Template reduces from 472 lines (~7,000 tokens) to approximately 360 lines (~4,200 tokens). A ~2,800-token reduction per Mode B run.

### Addendum 3: SKILL.md and Instructions File Minor Fixes

**For SKILL.md lines 117–121 (Marker policy block):**
Replace the current:
```
Marker policy:
- Use 🤖 for inferred statements.
- Use ❓ for unresolved required inputs.
- Use NEEDS and VERIFY for outstanding checks.
- Use DEFERRED only with explicit rationale.
```
With:
```
Marker policy: Apply rules as defined in the loaded condensed charter (copilot-instructions/). 
Do not restate marker rules here.
```
**Rationale:** The identical rules exist at `backend-service.instructions.md §Transparency Marker Rules` lines 40–51. Two sources of truth for the same rule will diverge after the first independent update to either file.

**For `backend-service.instructions.md §Section-Scoped Generation Rules` lines 125–132:**
These four pass-discipline rules (`Load only needed charter slice...`, `Build forward payload...`, `Do not re-expand...`, `If pass split is used...`) are workflow orchestration. They exist verbatim in SKILL.md at lines 109–115 (SSG rules block).
Replace with:
```
## Section-Scoped Generation Rules
SSG pass discipline is governed by SKILL.md §SSG rules. This file does not restate workflow steps.
```

## Part 4: The `modules.yaml` Schema — Definitive Specification

This schema is the single most important new artifact in the entire implementation. `validate_documentation.py`, `consolidate.py`, and both Agent Skill modes all read from it.

```yaml
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    doc_output: docs/database/training_Courses_doc.md
    status: draft
```

### Schema Validation Rules for `validate_documentation.py` v1.0

> **Schema note:** `modules-schema.json` is now the canonical schema for the lean manifest model. `validate_documentation.py` and related tooling should validate against that schema rather than assuming the earlier rich module-entry shape.

| Field | Rule | Error Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `project.layer` | Must be in `["UI", "API", "Database", "Integration", "Infrastructure", "Full-Stack"]` (mirrors `akr-config-schema.json` `projectInfo.layer` enum; validated against `modules-schema.json` at runtime) | Fail with enum error |
| `project.standards_version` | Must be ≥ `minimum_standards_version` | Fail with version lag error |
| `modules[].grouping_status` | Must be in `[draft, approved]` | Fail with unknown grouping status error |
| `modules[].files` length | Must not exceed 8 | Fail with module size error |
| `modules[].doc_output` | Must not be used by more than one module | Fail with duplicate output error |
| `database_objects[].type` | Must be in `[table, view, procedure, function]` | Fail with unknown type error |
| `project.compliance_mode` | Must be `pilot` or `production` | Fail with invalid mode error |

**`project_type` in YAML front matter (Review 6 addition):** The existing `akr-config-schema.json` `validation.tagValidation.requiredTags` defaults to `["feature", "domain", "layer"]`. It does **not** include `project_type`. Adding `project_type` as a required front matter field in module docs is a new requirement that extends the existing tag validation contract. Phase 1 must update `akr-config-schema.json` to add `project_type` to `requiredTags` for MODULE-type documents (as a conditional requirement based on doc type).

---

## Part 5: The Agent Skill — Three-Mode Specification

The Agent Skill is the primary workflow encoding mechanism. A single `SKILL.md` works across VS Code agent mode, the Copilot coding agent, and the Copilot CLI. Mode A (also referred to as the **DocumentPlanner** step) must precede Mode B, and Mode C handles interactive HITL completion for unresolved `❓` sections in existing drafts.

### 5.A SKILL.md Architecture: v1.0.0 Monolith vs. v1.1.0 Dispatcher Target

**Current state (v1.0.0):** The SKILL.md specified below is a **monolithic file** (~3,500 tokens). All three mode definitions (Mode A ProposeGroupings, Mode B GenerateDocumentation, Mode C ResolveUnknowns) are inline. Every skill invocation loads the full context — SSG pass definitions are loaded even for `groupings` and `resolve` modes that do not use them.

**v1.1.0 target (CL 41 Architectural Review):** The monolith is replaced by a **thin dispatcher** (~400 tokens) that routes to mode scripts on demand via `@github` tool calls, with fallback paths for offline or CI execution:

| Path | Mechanism | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| PATH A | `@github get file` loads mode script from `core-akr-templates` at runtime | VS Code agent mode with GitHub MCP extension authenticated |
| PATH B | Mode script loaded from locally distributed `scripts/` directory | VS Code without GitHub MCP; Visual Studio |
| PATH C | Mode script pre-fetched in CI/coding agent setup step | CI runners; Copilot coding agent async context |

The dispatcher enforces a budget of **max 2 `@github` tool calls per run** (one for the mode script + one for the condensed charter). The three mode scripts distributed alongside the dispatcher are:

- `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-groupings.md` (~600 tokens) — Mode A
- `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-generate.md` (~800 tokens) — Mode B
- `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-resolve.md` (~400 tokens) — Mode C

**Token savings vs. v1.0.0 monolith:** `groupings` mode ~65% reduction; `resolve` mode ~77% reduction; `generate` mode ~17% reduction.

**Implication for `distribute-skill.yml`:** v1.1.0 distributes `SKILL.md` (dispatcher) + `scripts/` directory (mode scripts as PATH B/C fallbacks). `validation/vale-rules/` and `validation/.vale.ini` are **not distributed** — vale rules are fetched at CI runtime from `.akr/vale-rules/` in `core-akr-templates` only. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is **explicitly excluded** from distribution (team ownership preserved).

The full v1.0.0 specification below remains the reference for mode content requirements. The v1.1.0 dispatcher splits that content across the mode scripts without altering the mode logic itself. Phase 0 SKILL.md authoring targets v1.0.0; the v1.1.0 refactor is a Phase 1 follow-on task once the mode content is validated.

---

**Reliability context (Review 9):** Agent Skills are invoked by the LLM on an intent-matching basis. Copilot (GPT-4o) can respond to a documentation request *without* loading the skill, and can execute the skill *without* completing all steps - both silently, with no error. The three-layer reliability stack documented in Part 16 addresses this directly. The `SKILL.md` specification in this section should be read alongside Part 16, which defines the required frontmatter properties, invocation contract, and in-document proof-of-execution that together make the skill enforceable rather than advisory.

**LLM-dependent execution quality (Review 9):** Skill execution quality varies by underlying model. The `akr-docs` skill is optimized for and benchmarked against **Claude Sonnet 4.6**. When running through GitHub Copilot (GPT-4o default), expect lower first-run pass rates, particularly for Mode B on large modules (>6 files). See `SKILL-COMPAT.md` for the full model compatibility matrix and per-model workarounds. The CI gate (`validate_documentation.py`) validates output regardless of which model ran the skill - it is the model-agnostic enforcement layer.

             and Mode C (interactive HITL completion for unresolved ❓ sections).
---

# AKR Documentation Workflow

## Mode A — Propose Module Groupings
## (Run first on any project that does not yet have an approved modules.yaml)

When asked to "propose module groupings", "initialize modules.yaml", or
"scan project for documentation modules":

1. Check whether modules.yaml exists in the project root.
   If it exists and has no modules with status: draft → redirect to Mode B.

2. Scan all source files by directory path and filename.
   Group files by the dominant domain noun in their path/name
   (e.g., Course, Enrollment, User, Training).

3. For each domain group, identify the following file roles:
   - Controller (HTTP entry point)
   - Service interface (IXxxService.cs)
   - Service implementation (XxxService.cs, if present)
   - Repository interface (IXxxRepository.cs)
   - Repository implementation (EfXxxRepository.cs, etc.)
   - DTOs / Contracts (XxxDtos.cs, XxxRequests.cs, XxxResponses.cs)
   For UI projects, identify:
   - Page component (XxxPage.tsx)
   - Sub-components (XxxList.tsx, XxxForm.tsx, XxxCard.tsx)
   - Custom hooks (useXxx.ts)
   - Type definitions (xxxTypes.ts, xxxInterfaces.ts)

4. Mark all database files (*.sql, SSDT project files, migration scripts,
   stored procedures) as database_objects — never group with application code.

5. Files that cannot be confidently assigned to a domain group → add to
   unassigned[] with a reason string.

6. Group files only; do not write `project_type` or business metadata into modules.yaml.

7. Write draft modules.yaml to project root.
  Set grouping_status: draft on all modules.

7.5. Write draft modules.yaml to the project root and stop for direct human review in VS Code.
  The manifest is the sole Mode A review surface.
  In chat, summarize the proposed modules, unassigned files, and any low-confidence placements.
  Instruct: "Review `modules.yaml` in VS Code. Make edits directly in the file, update module status based on your assessment, then reply 'approved'."

7.6. IF modules.yaml already exists (incremental update scenario):
  DO NOT run a full scan. Instead:
  - Read the existing modules.yaml
  - Identify files that are new or changed since the last approved grouping
  - Propose only the affected module entry updates in chat
  - Ask: "X new/changed file(s) detected. Proposed: [module]. Confirm?"
  - On confirmation: patch modules.yaml in-place and preserve existing human edits

8. ONLY after developer confirms approval:
   Preserve the reviewed modules.yaml as the authoritative grouping artifact.
   Open draft PR titled: "docs(mode-a): propose module groupings for [project name]"
   modules.yaml is the review source of truth for the PR branch.
   Include standard PR checklist.

---

## Mode B — Generate Module Documentation
## (Run only after modules.yaml grouping approval is complete — target module grouping_status is not draft)

When asked to "generate documentation for [ModuleName]" or
"document the [ModuleName] module":

1. Read modules.yaml from the project root.
   Find the module matching the requested name.
  If grouping_status is draft → stop and instruct developer to complete Mode A first.
  Load: file list and doc_output path.
  Infer project_type from the module file set.

2. Load the condensed charter from copilot-instructions/ based on project_type:
   - api-backend     → copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md
   - ui-component    → copilot-instructions/ui-component.instructions.md
   - microservice    → copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md
   - general         → copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md
   Do not load the full charter from charters/ — condensed only.

3. Read all source files listed in the module's files[] array.
   Do not read files outside the files[] list.

4. Generate the module documentation using the appropriate base template:
   - api-backend / microservice → lean_baseline_service_template.md (module variant)
   - ui-component               → ui_component_template.md (module variant)
   Apply these rules during generation:
   - Mark AI-inferred content: 🤖
   - Mark sections requiring human input: ❓
   - Module Files section: list all files with their role
   - Operations Map: cover ALL operations across all files in the module
   - Architecture diagram: text-based (no Mermaid); show full stack
     Controller → Service → Repository → DB table
   - Business Rules: include Why It Exists and Since When columns
   - Data Operations: cover all reads and writes across all files
   - Questions & Gaps: list all inferred assumptions needing confirmation

5. Run validate_documentation.py against the generated draft.
   Pass the --module-name flag so the script applies module-level section rules.
   Resolve or mark DEFERRED any validation failures before continuing.

5.5. BEFORE writing to doc_output, write the draft to the committed path and display
    a validation summary block in Copilot Chat.

    IF this is a first-time generation (draft_output path does not exist):
     Write draft to `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md`.
     Set front matter: preview-generated-at (ISO 8601), review-mode: full,
     passes-completed, generation-strategy.
     Display validation summary block:
     ── Mode B Preview: {ModuleName} ──────────────────────────────
     Sections present:     Module Files ✅ | Operations Map ✅ | Architecture ✅
                    Business Rules ✅ | Data Operations ✅ | Q&G ✅
     ❓ markers:           N sections require human input (listed below)
     🤖 inferred content:  N items flagged for review
     Validator result:     0 errors / N warnings
     Generation strategy:  SSG (passes-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
     Review mode:          Full generation
     ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Each ❓ section listed with its header and specific question.
     Instruction: "Edit `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` to fill ❓ sections,
     then reply 'ready to commit'."

    IF this is an incremental update (draft_output path exists):
     Read committed draft as primary context. DO NOT re-read all files or re-run full SSG
     unless patch scope expands beyond the initially identified changed files.
     Read only changed files (from developer instruction or git diff). [For later analysis (01-Apr-2026): What if there are multiple versions of the changed file(s) in git history since last_reviewed_at? Use the most recent version, but warn the developer about potential context drift if there are multiple changes. Do we also need to track the last git commit hash that was included in the draft context to detect rebases or force pushes that could cause drift?]
     Load only relevant charter sections for changed files:
     - Controller changed    → Operations Map charter section
     - Service/Repository    → Business Rules + Data Operations charter sections
     - DTOs changed          → Operations Map + Data Operations charter sections
     If patch scope reveals additional related sections require update, load those charter
     sections and patch them before presenting the summary - this is still incremental
     (draft as primary context) but may touch more than one section.
     Apply patch to committed draft in-place.
     Update front matter: preview-generated-at, review-mode: incremental.
     Display incremental validation summary:
     ── Mode B Incremental Update: {ModuleName} ───────────────────
     Sections patched:     [patched section names] ✅
     Sections unchanged:   [unchanged section names]
     New ❓ markers:       N (section - reason)
     Validator result:     0 errors / N warnings
     Generation strategy:  incremental-update
     ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Instruction: "Review patched sections in `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md`.
     Reply 'ready to commit' when satisfied."

    Do NOT open a PR until the developer confirms.

5.6. Update modules.yaml: last_reviewed_at and review_mode to reflect this run.

6. AFTER developer confirms 'ready to commit':
  Read `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` (containing developer edits).

  6a. STRIP draft-only front matter before writing the final doc. Remove these fields:
     - preview-generated-at
     - review-mode
     Any field present in the draft but not in the final doc YAML front matter spec
     must be removed here. Failure to strip these fields is a validator error on the
     final doc (see validate_documentation.py: "Final doc must not contain draft-only fields").

    6b. Inject final-doc front matter:
      - Ensure businessCapability, feature, layer, project_type, status, compliance_mode
      are present and correctly populated from source evidence plus GenerateDocumentation inference.
     - Carry the akr-generated metadata header forward from the draft (do not strip it).

  Write final version to the doc_output path on a new feature branch.
  Branch: docs/{module-name}-documentation (full) or docs/{module-name}-update-{date} (incremental)

7. Open a draft PR titled:
  Full:        "docs: [ModuleName] module documentation"
  Incremental: "docs: update [ModuleName] documentation — [changed file(s)]"
  Include validation summary block from Step 5.5 as PR description header.
  Note in PR body: "Pre-commit draft reviewed at docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md before PR open."
  For incremental: include diff summary showing sections patched vs. unchanged.

8. Write the akr-generated metadata header block to the TOP of the output file
  (this step is required - do not skip; validate_documentation.py checks for it):
  <!-- akr-generated
  skill: akr-docs
  skill-version: {SKILL_VERSION from header}
  mode: B
  template: {template used}
  charter: {condensed charter filename}
  steps-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
  generated-at: {ISO 8601 timestamp}
  -->

## Mode C — Interactive HITL Completion for Existing Drafts
## (Run when a document already exists and has unresolved ❓ sections)

When asked to "review unresolved questions", "walk me through ❓ sections", or
"finish HITL review for [DocName]":

1. Read the existing documentation file and enumerate unresolved `❓` markers.
  Group them by section and priority (critical first when in `production` mode).

2. Start an interactive pass in-editor:
  - Present one `❓` item at a time with local section context
  - Ask targeted clarification questions
  - Propose replacement text options grounded in code evidence

3. Apply accepted edits immediately to the document.
  - Replace resolved `❓` markers with finalized content
  - Keep unresolved items marked as `DEFERRED` with rationale and owner

4. Re-run validation checks after each section or batch:
  - `validate_documentation.py` for structural and marker policy
  - Vale checks for prose quality (if configured in repo)

### Skill Reliability Requirements (Review 9)

The SKILL.md specification above encodes the *workflow*. The following requirements ensure the workflow is **actually executed** - not silently bypassed or incompletely run. These requirements are Part 16 items translated into authoring obligations.

#### Required SKILL.md Frontmatter

The frontmatter block must appear *above* the `<!-- SKILL_VERSION -->` comment as the first content in the file:

```yaml
---
name: akr-docs
description: >
  Generate AKR module documentation following charters and templates.
  Invoke explicitly via /akr-docs [mode-a | mode-b | mode-c] [target].
disable-model-invocation: true
optimized-for: claude-sonnet-4-6
tested-on:
  - claude-sonnet-4-6   # ✅ pass rate ≥90%
  - gpt-4o              # ⚠️ ~75%, Mode B truncation on large modules
user-invocable: true
skill-version: 1.0.0
---
```

**`disable-model-invocation: true`** prevents Copilot from auto-loading the skill based on intent matching. Without this, the skill may not load at all on ambiguous requests, producing responses that look correct but were generated entirely from the model's training data - with no charter, no template, and no compliance with the AKR governance contract.

#### Required Self-Reporting Block (First SKILL Body Instruction)

The first instruction in the SKILL body (after the frontmatter and version comment) must be:

```
CRITICAL: When this skill is loaded, begin EVERY response with the following
confirmation block. Do not skip this under any circumstances.

✅ akr-docs INVOKED AND STEPS EXECUTED
Steps followed: 1. [first step description] — completed | 2. [second step] — completed | ...
```

This gives the developer immediate in-session confirmation that the skill loaded and ran. Its absence in a response is an early warning that the skill was not invoked - allowing the developer to retry with an explicit `/akr-docs` command before a PR is opened.

#### Companion File: `SKILL-COMPAT.md`

A companion `SKILL-COMPAT.md` must be maintained alongside `SKILL.md` at `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL-COMPAT.md`. It records:

- Model compatibility matrix (pass rates per eval case per model, updated from `evals/benchmark.json` after each eval run)
- Known model-specific failure modes with descriptions
- Recommended workaround prompts per model
- Re-evaluation policy: *"Re-run evals after any SKILL.md change or Copilot model update."*

This file is distributed to registered repositories alongside `SKILL.md` via `distribute-skill.yml`.

## Part 6: `validate_documentation.py` — Definitive v1.0 Scope

This is the most consequential scoping decision in Phase 1. The module architecture materially expanded v1.0 scope beyond what earlier analyses estimated.

### What v1.0 Must Do (Non-Negotiable)

The script must distinguish module documents from database object documents before applying any section rules. Without this distinction, Vale and section-presence checks fire false positives on module docs that correctly omit single-service sections.

```
validate_documentation.py --file <path> [--module-name <name>] [--fail-on never|needs|all]

Execution flow:
1. Check whether modules.yaml exists in project root.
   If absent → warn and skip module-type-aware validation; apply generic rules only.
   (Fallback behavior: do not fail hard on missing modules.yaml in v1.0)

2. If modules.yaml exists → load it (pyyaml, declared dependency).
   Determine doc type for the file being validated:
   - If file path matches a modules[].doc_output → type = MODULE, load module metadata
   - If file path matches database_objects[].doc_output → type = DB_OBJECT
   - If no match → type = UNKNOWN, apply generic rules

3. Validate modules.yaml itself (separate validation pass):
   - project.layer in akr-config-schema.json enum
   - project.standards_version >= minimum_standards_version
  - Each module: grouping_status in allowed values
  - Each module: files count <= 8
   - No duplicate doc_output paths

4. Apply section rules based on doc type:
   MODULE docs require:
     - Module Files (list of all files with roles)
     - Operations Map (all operations across all files)
     - Architecture Overview (full-stack text diagram)
     - Business Rules (with Why It Exists + Since When columns)
     - Data Operations (all reads and writes)
     - YAML front matter with: feature, layer, project_type, status
     - <!-- akr-generated --> metadata header block at document top
       (absence → FAIL with: "AKR metadata header missing — skill may not
       have been properly invoked. Re-run using /akr-docs mode-b [module].")

   DB_OBJECT docs require:
     - Object Definition (schema, columns/parameters)
     - Relationships and Dependencies
     - Usage Patterns
     - YAML front matter with: object_type, source

   UNKNOWN docs:
     - Apply generic required sections from lean_baseline_service_template.md
     - Warn that doc is not registered in modules.yaml

5. Check transparency markers:
   - Count unresolved ❓ markers
   - Fail on ❓ if compliance_mode = production
   - Warn on ❓ if compliance_mode = pilot
   - DEFERRED markers with justification text → always pass
   - 🤖 markers → informational only, do not fail

6. Apply --fail-on logic:
   --fail-on=never:  exit 0 always; emit warnings to stdout
   --fail-on=needs:  exit 1 on unresolved ❓ in production mode; else exit 0
   --fail-on=all:    exit 1 on any validation failure

7. Emit structured output:
   PASS/FAIL/WARN per check; summary count; list of specific failures with line refs
```

### Explicit Dependencies

- `pyyaml` — YAML front matter and `modules.yaml` parsing (explicit; not optional)
- `Vale` — prose quality rules (subprocess call; installed separately)
- Python 3.9+ — standard library only beyond `pyyaml` and Vale

### What Defers to v1.1

| Feature | Reason for Deferral |
|---|---|
| `--auto-fix` mode (insert missing sections) | Requires template-aware content generation; too complex for v1.0 |
| `--check-sync` mode (detect code changes without doc updates) | Requires file diff integration; Phase 2 feature |
| `--tier` completeness scoring | Threshold logic can be added after v1.0 section checks are stable |
| `feature-registry.yaml` cross-repo validation | Phase 4 dependency; `tag-registry.json` local validation is sufficient for v1.0 |
| Full Vale subprocess integration | Vale can run as a separate CI step in v1.0; tight integration in v1.1 |
| Model-specific pass-rate adaptive logic | Detecting which model ran the skill and adjusting validation thresholds accordingly - `benchmark.json` data provides the inputs but the logic is v1.1 scope; v1.0 applies uniform rules regardless of model |
| `--check-sync` flag (draft staleness detection) | Compares `last_reviewed_at` in modules.yaml against `git log` dates on module files; emits WARNING when draft is stale; requires git subprocess integration not in v1.0 scope |
| Committed draft presence validation | Checks that `draft_output` path in modules.yaml resolves to an existing file; emits WARNING if declared but absent; v1.0 only warns on `doc_output` absence |
| `review_mode` consistency check | If `review_mode: incremental` in draft front matter but `passes-completed` includes full pass sequence, emit INFO suggesting possible mislabeling |

The `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header check is explicitly **v1.0 scope** - it is not deferred. It is the in-document enforcement contract for the three-layer reliability stack and must be present before the pilot begins.

### Realistic Scope

Based on the full v1.0 feature set: **500–650 lines** with `pyyaml` as an explicit dependency. The prior "~300 lines, no dependencies" estimate was based on a pre-module-architecture scope. Plan Phase 1 accordingly — this is 1–2 weeks of focused development and testing, not a side deliverable.

### Testing Requirements

Port structural assertions from `akr-mcp-server/tests/test_validation_library.py` as the test baseline. `validate_documentation.py` should pass analogous tests for:
- Module doc with all required sections → PASS
- Module doc missing Operations Map → FAIL with correct message
- Module doc with unresolved `❓` in production mode → FAIL
- DB object doc missing Relationships section → FAIL
- `modules.yaml` with module exceeding `max_files` → FAIL
- `modules.yaml` with unknown `grouping_status` → FAIL
- `modules.yaml` absent from project → WARN, do not fail

## Part 7: `copilot-instructions.md` — Required Full Replacement

The existing `.akr/standards/copilot-instructions.md` is not a partial update. Direct file inspection (Review 7) confirms it is approximately 90%+ MCP-server-specific content that is broken by design after the archive. The rewrite is effectively a full document replacement. Estimate: **3–4 hours of focused authoring**, not a quick edit.

### What Must Be Removed Entirely (Six Sections)

**1. Slash-Commands section (~52 lines):** Every slash command is an MCP server invocation:
`/docs.generate`, `/docs.interview`, `/docs.update`, `/docs.update.api`, `/docs.update.architecture`, `/docs.my-role`, `/docs.set-role`, `/docs.health-check`, `/docs.update-templates`. All broken after archive. Remove the entire section.

**Purpose correction for `/docs.interview`:** its intended purpose was not pre-generation module confirmation. It was an interactive HITL flow to guide developers through filling `❓` sections in existing documents. In the new architecture, that capability is replaced by Agent Skill **Mode C**.

**2. Code Analysis Capabilities section (lines 183–205):** Explicitly instructs Copilot to "leverage Tree-sitter AST parsing" for all project types. Replace wholesale with Copilot-native code analysis guidance (read source files, follow dependency graph, infer from naming conventions).

**3. Repository Structure Requirements section (lines 104–121):**
- Vale installation path `.vale/styles/AKR/` conflicts with the new `validation/vale-rules/` migration target — must update
- Output directories `docs/components/`, `docs/services/`, `docs/architecture/` must become `docs/modules/`, `docs/database/`, `docs/features/` per the three-tier hierarchy

**4. YAML front matter example (lines 128–144):** Uses `component_type`, `technologies`, `business_domain`, `priority`, `last_updated` — none of which are in the `modules.yaml` schema's required fields (`feature`, `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, `compliance_mode`). Replace with module-level front matter example.

**5. Template selection logic:** Current logic selects templates based on a single file's complexity. This is structurally wrong under the module architecture. See new template selection table below.

**6. Support and Troubleshooting section (lines 300–318):** References `.vscode/mcp.json`, `~/.akr/templates/`, and `python scripts/validate-docs.py` (old script name — not `validate_documentation.py`). All three reference the archived MCP server. Remove entirely.

### What Must Be Retained (Three Elements Only)

- **Core Principles section** — transparency markers (`🤖`, `❓`, `DEFERRED`), HITL principles — retain with modifications to align marker semantics with `modules.yaml` `compliance_mode` behavior
- **Completeness scoring formula** — retain as-is
- **Vale quality gates reference** — retain, updating the Vale config path from `.akr/.vale.ini` to `validation/.vale.ini`

### New Template Selection Table (Replacement Content)

### New Template Selection Table

| `project_type` | Base Template | Condensed Charter | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-backend` | `lean_baseline_service_template.md` (module variant) | `backend-service.instructions.md` | Covers Controller + Service + Repository + DTOs |
| `ui-component` | `ui_component_template.md` (module variant) | `ui-component.instructions.md` | Covers Page + sub-components + hooks + types |
| `microservice` | `lean_baseline_service_template.md` (module variant) | `backend-service.instructions.md` | Service-to-service pattern; no controller layer |
| `general` | `lean_baseline_service_template.md` | `backend-service.instructions.md` | Fallback; apply judgment |
| `table` (DB object) | `table_doc_template.md` | `database.instructions.md` | Individual object; no grouping |
| `view` (DB object) | `table_doc_template.md` | `database.instructions.md` | Individual object |
| `procedure` (DB object) | `embedded_database_template.md` | `database.instructions.md` | Individual object |

### What Else Must Be Added (New Content)

- Module grouping principles (domain noun, dependency graph, DTO alignment, interface/implementation pairs)
- `project_type` → condensed charter → template mapping table (below)
- `modules.yaml` front matter field reference
- Three-mode Agent Skill invocation guidance (when to use Mode A, Mode B, and Mode C)

### Authoring Note

The replacement document should be approximately 150–200 lines. The current file is considerably longer because of MCP-server-specific verbosity. The goal is a concise, Copilot-native reference that a developer reads once during onboarding — not an exhaustive manual.

---

## Part 8: `layer` vs. `project_type` — Definitive Distinction

This was conflated in prior analyses and is now definitively clarified. An important schema correction from Review 6 also applies here.

| Field | Level | Values | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `layer` | **Project-level** in `modules.yaml project:` section | `UI`, `API`, `Database`, `Integration`, `Infrastructure`, `Full-Stack` | Enum values sourced from `akr-config-schema.json`'s `projectInfo.layer` — **but `modules.yaml` is a new artifact validated by `modules-schema.json`, not by `akr-config-schema.json` directly** | Describes the architectural tier of the whole repository |
| `project_type` | **Generated-document field** inferred from module file patterns during Mode B | `api-backend`, `ui-component`, `microservice`, `general` | Inference logic defined in `SKILL.md` GenerateDocumentation Step 2 | Drives charter selection and template selection for each documentation unit without bloating `modules.yaml` |

A repository with `layer: API` (the whole project is an API) can contain modules whose file patterns infer `project_type: api-backend` (standard CRUD modules) or `project_type: microservice` (lightweight orchestration services). A repository with `layer: UI` contains modules whose file patterns infer `project_type: ui-component`.

**Critical schema correction (Review 6):** `akr-config-schema.json` is the schema for `.akr-config.json` — a separate project-level configuration object covering `projectInfo`, `documentation`, `crossRepository`, `tags`, `validation`, `humanInput`, and `monitoring`. It is **not** a schema for `modules.yaml`. The `layer` enum lives inside `projectInfo.layer` within that config schema and is the source of valid values, but `modules.yaml` validation must reference the new `modules-schema.json`, not `akr-config-schema.json` directly.

**Consequence for implementation:** `modules-schema.json` validates the lean manifest structure, while `project_type` is inferred at generation time and written into document front matter rather than stored in `modules.yaml`. `validate_documentation.py` validates `layer` against the enum values defined in `modules-schema.json` (which mirrors `akr-config-schema.json`'s `projectInfo.layer` enum) and validates generated document front matter `project_type` as part of document-content checks. They are not the same validation rule, and neither references `akr-config-schema.json` at runtime.

---

## Part 9: Phase 4 `consolidate.py` — Revised Data Contract

The module architecture changes how `consolidate.py` reads its inputs. Review 6's schema inspection also reveals that the cross-repository configuration is split across two schemas with overlapping responsibilities — both must be understood before Phase 4 implementation begins.

### What Changes From Prior Analysis

**Before module architecture:** `consolidate.py` was expected to read individual component docs (`CourseService_doc.md`, `CoursesController_doc.md`) as separate inputs for the `FOR_EACH_API_COMPONENT` loop.

**After module architecture:** `consolidate.py` reads module docs (`CourseDomain_doc.md`) as atomic units. `CourseDomain_doc.md` already covers the controller, service, repository, and DTOs — iterating over individual component files is no longer correct.

### The Dual Cross-Repository Configuration — Schema Correction (Review 6)

`consolidation-config-schema.json` defines the **job runner** configuration: which repositories to clone (Git URLs, branches, credentials), caching, parallel processing limits, webhook triggers, and output format. Its current `docsPath` + `includePatterns` glob assumes individual component docs, not `modules.yaml`-driven module docs. It has **no concept of `modules.yaml`**.

`akr-config-schema.json` defines **per-project participation**: the `crossRepository` section (lines 155–316) specifies `consolidationRepo`, `registryUrl`, `publishFeatureDocs`, `relatedRepositories[]`, `syncSchedule`, and a dual `outputs[]` array referencing both `feature-consolidated.md` and `feature-testing-consolidated.md`. This is the per-project opt-in contract.

**Which config drives which decision:**

| Config File | Drives | Read By |
|---|---|---|
| `akr-config-schema.json` (`crossRepository` section) | **Participation**: does this repo contribute? Which consolidation repo? Which related repos? | `consolidate.py` at participation discovery time |
| `consolidation-config-schema.json` | **Execution**: which repos to clone, how to discover docs, output format, parallelism | `consolidate.py` at job execution time |

**Phase 4 schema evolution:** `consolidation-config-schema.json` already defines top-level path fields (`tagRegistryPath`, `templatePath`, `outputDir`, `cacheDir`). Adding `modulesManifestPath` (defaulting to `modules.yaml`) follows this existing pattern exactly — it is a single additional field consistent with the established design, not a structural change. `consolidate.py` reads `modules.yaml` first when `modulesManifestPath` is present; falls back to `docs/**/*.md` glob scan when absent (backward compatibility for repositories not yet onboarded).

**Note on `repositories[].layer` enum:** The current `consolidation-config-schema.json` `repositories[].layer` enum is `["UI", "API", "Database", "Integration", "Infrastructure"]` — it does **not** include `"Full-Stack"`. This differs from `akr-config-schema.json`'s `projectInfo.layer` which does include `"Full-Stack"`. Either add `"Full-Stack"` to the consolidation schema's layer enum in Phase 4, or document that `Full-Stack` repositories must self-identify a primary layer for consolidation participation. The `modules.yaml` schema's `project.layer` should match `akr-config-schema.json` (includes `Full-Stack`) since it describes a single repository's architectural tier, not a repository's participation role in a consolidation job.

### `warnOnMissingLayers` — Already Defined, Not New Logic (Review 6)

`consolidation-config-schema.json` already defines `validation.warnOnMissingLayers: true` — it warns when a feature doc is missing UI, API, or DB layer representation. `consolidate.py` reads this existing flag; the missing-layer warning is **not new logic to implement** from scratch.

### Revised Input Contract

```python
# consolidate.py execution sequence:
# 1. Read consolidation-config-schema.json for job execution config
#    - repositories[] to clone
#    - modulesManifestPath (default: modules.yaml) — NEW field
#    - docsPath fallback if modules.yaml absent
#    - validation.warnOnMissingLayers (existing flag — read, don't implement)
#
# 2. For each repository, read akr-config-schema.json crossRepository section
#    - Confirm publishFeatureDocs: true (opt-in)
#    - Read relatedRepositories[] for cross-repo dependency mapping
#
# 3. Read modules.yaml from each participating repository
#    Input sources per feature_tag:
#    FOR_EACH_API_COMPONENT  → modules[] where feature matches feature_tag
#                              AND project_type in [api-backend, microservice]
#    FOR_EACH_UI_COMPONENT   → modules[] where feature matches feature_tag
#                              AND project_type = ui-component
#    FOR_EACH_DB_COMPONENT   → database_objects[] where feature matches feature_tag
#                              (database objects are still individual units)
#
# 4. Fill feature-consolidated.md template {FOR_EACH_X}...{END_FOR_EACH} syntax
#    No AI invocation from Actions
```

### Design Principle Confirmed

`consolidate.py` is deterministic Python — no AI invocation from GitHub Actions. The non-deterministic part (synthesizing a coherent business narrative) is done by the Product Owner with Copilot agent mode assistance on the structured draft. This eliminates Assumption 4 (Copilot-from-Actions) entirely.

---

## Part 10: AI Tooling — Final Consolidated Evaluation

### Architecture Diagram & Narrative: Ideal End-State Architecture

**[View Interactive Architecture Diagram](akr_architecture_diagram.html)** 

The diagram above illustrates how all components connect in the fully realised system. Five conceptual zones are shown, each with a distinct responsibility boundary.

**Standards Layer — `core-akr-templates` as GitHub Hosted MCP Context Source**

The repository serves as the single source of truth for all governance artefacts. When configured as a GitHub Hosted MCP Context Source (subject to pre-pilot Test 2 validation at your Copilot Business plan tier), its contents — condensed charters, templates, the validation script, and `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` — are made available to Copilot Chat and the coding agent without any local server or custom infrastructure. Full charters remain in `charters/` as reference documentation; only the condensed versions (~2,500 tokens each) are loaded as active context. This is the architectural answer to the context saturation problem: the governance layer is in the repository, not in a running process.

**Developer Workflow Layer — Agent Skills + Copilot Surfaces**

The Agent Skill (`SKILL.md`) is authored once and auto-loads across three surfaces simultaneously: VS Code agent mode (developer-present, interactive), the Copilot coding agent (asynchronous, issue-to-PR), and the Copilot CLI. Mode A proposes module groupings and writes a draft `modules.yaml`; Mode B generates module documentation after groupings are human-validated. `project_type` is inferred from the module file set during Mode B step 2, and the skill then loads the correct condensed charter. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` carries global style rules and acts as the Assumption 2 fallback if hosted MCP context sources are unavailable at the current plan tier.

**CI / Governance Layer — GitHub Actions**

`validate_documentation.py` runs in GitHub Actions on every PR that touches `docs/**/*.md`. It reads `modules.yaml` to determine document type (module doc vs. database object doc) and applies the correct required section rules accordingly — this module-type awareness is what prevents false positives on Level 1 documents. Vale prose rules enforce language quality independently. `consolidate.py` runs as a deterministic Python aggregator in Phase 4, matching module docs by `feature_tag` to produce Level 3 feature consolidations with no AI invocation from Actions.

**Cross-Functional Review Layer — Copilot Studio in Teams (Phase 3+)**

When a PR is labelled `docs-review-required`, a Copilot Studio agent in Microsoft Teams surfaces the PR summary to the relevant non-developer stakeholders — product owner, QA lead, security reviewer — and gates merge on their approval. This layer exists specifically for contributors who do not work in GitHub or VS Code. It is conditional on confirmed Microsoft 365 Copilot licensing and a modelled credit budget, and should not be planned before those prerequisites are met.

**Three-Tier Documentation Output**

The diagram also shows the three documentation levels as outputs, not as system components. Level 1 (module docs) is produced by the coding agent or agent mode via the Agent Skill. Level 2 (database object docs) follows the same workflow but uses individual object templates without grouping. Level 3 (feature consolidation docs) is produced by `consolidate.py` after Levels 1 and 2 are complete and tagged. No Level 3 output is possible until the lower levels are stable — the dependency direction is one-way.

**What Is Not in the Diagram**

The diagram shows the ideal end-state. Two components are conditional and explicitly noted in the footer: hosted MCP context source availability is subject to pre-pilot Test 2 validation, and the Copilot Studio layer requires M365 licensing confirmation. If hosted MCP is unavailable, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with the condensed charter substitutes at zero additional cost. If Copilot Studio is unavailable, the HITL model operates with three levels rather than four — the CI gate and PR review remain fully effective without the Teams layer.

**Named Architectural Constraint: Zero Cloud Infrastructure, No Incremental Cost**

This program assumes no new cloud infrastructure and no incremental platform cost beyond existing Copilot seat entitlements and premium request consumption. Architecture decisions in all phases must be evaluated against this constraint; any proposal that introduces net-new cloud runtime must be justified by a documented failure at Phase 2.5.

### Tooling Decisions Requiring No Further Analysis

| Decision | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Archive `akr-mcp-server` immediately | ✅ Final | Zero server tests, zero adoption, Windows-only, version drift |
| Agent Skills as primary workflow encoding | ✅ Final | Cross-surface, free, single authoring effort |
| Copilot coding agent as Phase 2.5 | ✅ Final | Zero infrastructure; test-based acceptance criteria available |
| Zero cloud infrastructure / no incremental cost is a design constraint | ✅ Final | Existing tooling surfaces are sufficient for pilot and foundation phases; net-new cloud runtime requires explicit Phase 2.5 failure evidence |
| Charter compression before pre-pilot spike | ✅ Final | Guaranteed failure without it; not a risk to test |
| Phase 4 as deterministic Python + human refinement | ✅ Final | Eliminates unverified Assumption 4 |
| `project_type` and `layer` as separate fields | ✅ Final | Different concepts; different validation rules |
| `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` narrowed to version registry | ✅ Final | Skill-template version coupling requires it; other roles deprecated |
| Phase 3 conditional on Phase 2.5 failure | ✅ Final | Cannot justify Azure Function without evidence coding agent is insufficient |
| Agent Skill reliability requires explicit enforcement, not intent-matching alone | ✅ Final (Review 9) | Three failure modes confirmed: silent non-invocation, partial execution, context saturation. Three-layer stack (frontmatter gate + session hooks + metadata header contract) is the resolution. CI gate is the model-agnostic backstop regardless of which surface ran the skill |

### Tooling Decisions Still Requiring Input

| Decision | Open Question | How to Resolve |
|---|---|---|
| Copilot Studio Doc Review agent | Does the org have M365 Copilot licenses? | Check licensing before Phase 3 planning |
| Premium request metering | What is the monthly allowance and overage rate? | Model before Phase 2.5; use GitHub billing dashboard |
| Copilot Enterprise Knowledge Base | Is tier upgrade planned or under consideration? | Strategic roadmap question; log for future |
| Remote MCP (HTTP + OAuth) | Is shared team access a Phase 3+ requirement? | Validate after pilot proves governance value |

## Part 11: Five Pre-Pilot Validation Tests — With Module-Architecture Updates

All five tests must pass (or have documented fallback architectures) before Phase 1 delivery work begins. Tests 1 and 3 now have updated acceptance criteria reflecting the module architecture.

| Test | What It Validates | Updated Acceptance Criteria | Fail Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Code Analysis Capability | Copilot + condensed charter extracts module-level content correctly; skill invocation confirmed | Agent correctly groups 5 files into one CourseDomain doc; covers Controller + Service + Repository + DTOs in a single output; ≥90% section match across 3 runs; **self-reporting block present in all 3 runs**; **`<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header present in output** (Review 9 additions — these are now required pass criteria, not optional observations) | Hybrid: retain `CodeAnalyzer` from `akr-mcp-server` for deterministic extraction; hosted MCP for governance |
| 2 — Context Source Configuration | `core-akr-templates` available as hosted MCP context source at current plan tier | Context source appears in Settings → Copilot → MCP; available in VS Code + Visual Studio; context pulled on new sessions | Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with condensed charter as primary delivery |
| 2A — GitHub MCP Server Charter Access (Supplemental) | GitHub MCP Server available in VS Code via `@github` tool calls; on-demand charter pull confirmed | `@github get files with names like CHARTER.md` returns `.akr/charters/AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` and compressed charters from `core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions/`; GitHub MCP extension installed and authenticated; no additional licensing required | Visual Studio parity to be determined in Phase 2 Deliverable 5; Test 2 (Hosted MCP) remains FALLBACK |
| 3 — Large Module Stress Test | Module with 8 files, 2,000+ LOC: no section truncation | All module-required sections present (Module Files, Operations Map, full-stack diagram, Business Rules, Data Operations); validate_documentation.py passes | `max_files: 8` enforced as governance ceiling; provide `max_files: 5` guidance for large-file modules |
| 4 — GitHub Actions Invocability | Whether Copilot can be invoked from Actions (Phase 4 automation) | Either: working Copilot-from-Actions mechanism documented, or Phase 4 deterministic aggregation design confirmed as sufficient | Phase 4 deterministic aggregation (already designed; this test confirms the fallback is the plan) |
| 5 — Data Governance / Compliance | Legal and security sign-off on Copilot processing org code | Written approval from governance and legal; Copilot data handling confirmed against org data residency requirements | Manual documentation with templates only; no AI generation assistance |

**Prerequisite before Test 1:** Backend condensed charter (`backend-service.instructions.md`) must exist at ~2,500 tokens. Test 1 is not interpretable without it.

## Part 12A: Schema Audit Findings — Four Corrections and Three Additions (Review 6)

Full inspection of `akr-config-schema.json` and `consolidation-config-schema.json` reveals seven items that affect implementation plan accuracy. None change the strategy; they change the accuracy of specific Phase 1 and Phase 4 tasks.

### Correction Summary

**C1 — `modules-schema.json` does not exist and must be authored in Phase 1.**
`akr-config-schema.json` is the schema for `.akr-config.json`, not for `modules.yaml`. `modules.yaml` is a new artifact with no existing schema. `validate_documentation.py` cannot reference an existing schema file for `layer` enum validation at runtime — it must reference the new `modules-schema.json` once that file is authored. Until then, enum values are enforced programmatically. Add "author `core-akr-templates/schemas/modules-schema.json`" as an explicit Phase 1 deliverable.

**C2 — `consolidation-config-schema.json` has no `modules.yaml` awareness and must be evolved in Phase 4.**
The current schema assumes `consolidate.py` scans `docs/**/*.md` by glob. `consolidate.py` now needs to read `modules.yaml` first. Phase 4 must add a `modulesManifestPath` field (defaulting to `modules.yaml`) to `consolidation-config-schema.json`. The existing `docsPath` + `includePatterns` remains as the fallback for repositories not yet onboarded to the module architecture.

**C3 — Cross-repository configuration is split across two schemas with overlapping responsibilities.**
`akr-config-schema.json`'s `crossRepository` section (lines 155–316) handles participation: which consolidation repo to publish to, which related repos contribute, sync schedule, and dual `outputs[]` referencing both `feature-consolidated.md` and `feature-testing-consolidated.md` with `sectionMapping`. `consolidation-config-schema.json` handles execution: repo cloning, auth, parallelism, output format. `consolidate.py` must read both. The implementation plan must document this split explicitly so the Phase 4 builder does not re-implement logic that already exists in `akr-config-schema.json`'s `sectionMapping`.

**C4 — `project_type` is not in the existing `requiredTags` contract.**
`akr-config-schema.json`'s `validation.tagValidation.requiredTags` defaults to `["feature", "domain", "layer"]`. It does not include `project_type`. Phase 1 must update this array to include `project_type` as a conditional required tag for MODULE-type documents.

### Addition Summary

**A1 — `humanInput` schema (lines 480–516 of `akr-config-schema.json`) maps directly to the ❓ marker HITL model.**
The schema defines `triggerMode` (`always`, `on-new-file`, `manual`), `priorityFilter` (`critical`, `important`, `optional`), and `defaultRole` with values `developer`, `technical_lead`, `product_owner`, `qa_tester`, `scrum_master`, `general`. These map cleanly to the four-level HITL model:

| `defaultRole` | Maps To |
|---|---|
| `technical_lead` | Level 1 grouping validation + Level 2 architecture review |
| `developer` | Level 2 content review (fills ❓ sections) |
| `product_owner` | Phase 4 narrative refinement |
| `qa_tester` | Copilot Studio Teams approval gate (Phase 3+) |

Phase 1 should cross-reference `humanInput.defaultRole` against the "who provides it" column in the adapted templates, so the two systems use consistent role vocabulary. `validate_documentation.py` can eventually read `humanInput.priorityFilter` to determine which ❓ markers are blocking (`critical`) vs. advisory (`optional`).

**A2 — `warnOnMissingLayers` is already defined in `consolidation-config-schema.json`.**
`consolidation-config-schema.json` at line 220 defines `validation.warnOnMissingLayers: true`. This is already the missing-layer governance rule. `consolidate.py` reads this existing flag and emits the warning based on it — this is not new logic to implement from scratch. Document it as reading an existing config field.

**A3 — `monitoring` schema feeds the Phase 0 cost baseline requirement.**
`akr-config-schema.json` at lines 518–545 defines a `monitoring` object with `trackMetrics: ["generation-time", "validation-results", "human-input-completion", "cross-repo-sync"]` and a `reportingEndpoint` URI. Enabling `monitoring: { enabled: true, trackMetrics: ["generation-time", "validation-results"] }` in the per-project `.akr-config.json` during Phase 0/2 pilot provides a documentation-layer signal of generation workflow usage. This is not a substitute for GitHub billing dashboard monitoring, but it provides a usage baseline that costs nothing to collect. Add to Phase 0: "Enable `monitoring` in pilot project's `.akr-config.json`; collect generation-time baseline across first 10 module documentation runs."

### Complete Schema Audit Impact Table

| Item | Type | Phase Affected | Implementation Plan Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `modules-schema.json` does not exist | Correction | Phase 1 | Add "author `schemas/modules-schema.json`" as explicit deliverable |
| `consolidation-config-schema.json` has no `modules.yaml` awareness | Correction | Phase 4 | Add `modulesManifestPath` field; `consolidate.py` reads it first |
| Dual cross-repo config schemas overlap | Correction | Phase 4 design | Document: `akr-config-schema.json` drives participation; `consolidation-config-schema.json` drives execution |
| `project_type` not in existing `requiredTags` | Correction | Phase 1 | Update `akr-config-schema.json` `requiredTags` to include `project_type` (conditional) |
| `humanInput` schema maps to ❓ HITL model | Addition | Phase 1 alignment | Cross-reference `defaultRole` enum against template "who provides it" column |
| `warnOnMissingLayers` already defined | Addition | Phase 4 scope | `consolidate.py` reads existing flag; not new logic |
| `monitoring` schema exists for cost baseline | Addition | Phase 0 | Enable in pilot `.akr-config.json`; collect generation-time baseline |
| `tag-registry.json` uses PascalCase keys; `modules.yaml` example used free text | Correction (Review 7) | Phase 0 + Phase 1 | Update `feature` field to PascalCase; add `CourseCatalogManagement` entry to `tag-registry.json` in Phase 0 |

## Part 12B: Complete Gap Inventory — All Reviews Consolidated

**🔴 CRITICAL FINDING — Added After Schema Audit:**
**`validate_documentation.py` does not exist in the repository.** The workflow at `.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` attempts to download the script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/scripts/validate_documentation.py`, but this path does not exist and the download returns a 404. The script must be **created from scratch** as a Phase 1 deliverable, separate from the workflow adaptation task. The script location shall be `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` in `core-akr-templates`, keeping it inside the `.akr/` governance subtree. During workflow adaptation, the download URL must be corrected from the broken path to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`. This is two Phase 1 deliverables: (1) **Build new** `validate_documentation.py` (~500–650 lines) + (2) **Adapt existing** `validate-documentation.yml` (five targeted changes, including fixing the URL).

| Gap | Source | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Charter compression not done | Review 3 (quantified) | 🔴 Blocking | Phase 0 first deliverable |
| `validate_documentation.py` does not exist; must be created from scratch | Final file inspection | 🔴 Blocking for Phase 1 | Author `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` in core-akr-templates (~500–650 lines); correct workflow download URL from broken path to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` |
| Module-type awareness in validator | Module architecture | 🔴 Blocking for v1.0 | Read `modules.yaml`; apply different section rules per doc type |

| Mode A sequencing not enforced | Module architecture | 🟡 High | Skill checks `modules.yaml` status before Mode B |
| Pre-pilot assumptions are load-bearing | Review 1 + all | 🟡 High | Blocking gate before Phase 1 |
| Charter selection logic undefined | Review 3 + Module arch | 🟡 High | `project_type` inference rule + Agent Skill step 2 |
| `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` disposition unresolved | Review 3 / M365 | 🟡 High | Narrow to version registry; deprecate other roles |
| `--fail-on` graduation criteria undefined | Review 1 + 2 | 🟡 High | `compliance_mode` field in `modules.yaml`; formal approval process |
| Premium request metering unmodeled | Review 4 (M365) | 🟡 High | Model before Phase 2.5; use GitHub billing dashboard |
| `validate_doc.py` cross-platform untested | Review 1 + 3 | 🟡 High | Test Ubuntu + macOS + Windows in Phase 1 |
| Standards version drift unmitigated | Review 1 | 🟡 High | `minimum_standards_version` in validator |
| Azure Function breaks zero-infra premise | Review 1 + 2 | 🟡 Medium | Phase 3 conditional on Phase 2.5 failure |
| Phase 4 Assumption 4 (Copilot from Actions) | All reviews | 🟡 Medium | Deterministic aggregation design resolves |
| `.akr/workflows/` not audited | Review 3 | 🟡 Medium | Audit in Phase 0; migrate rather than rebuild |
| Gitmodule paths invisible to `git grep` | Review 3 | 🟡 Medium | Extended inventory in Phase 0 |
| `modules.yaml` absent: fallback behavior | Module architecture | 🟡 Medium | Warn + skip module-type rules; do not fail hard |
| `test_pipeline_e2e.py` not reused as criteria | Review 3 | 🟠 Medium | Port as Phase 2.5 acceptance criteria |
| `unassigned[]` handling in validator | Module architecture | 🟠 Medium | Warn only; human reviews during Mode A PR |
| Copilot Studio licensing not confirmed | Review 4 (M365) | 🟠 Medium | Check M365 licenses before Phase 3 planning |
| `feature-consolidated.md` `FOR_EACH_*` contract | Module architecture | 🟠 Medium | Document mapping: module docs as loop inputs for API/UI |
| Vale migration complexity understated | Review 2 + 3 | 🟠 Medium | Audit `.akr/vale-rules/` depth; run Vale separately in v1.0 CI |
| `generate_lean_backend_doc` pattern not preserved | Review 2 | 🟠 Low | Archive notes; reference design for condensed charter |
| `modules-schema.json` does not exist | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🔴 Blocking for Phase 1 | Author `core-akr-templates/schemas/modules-schema.json` as Phase 1 deliverable |
| `consolidation-config-schema.json` has no `modules.yaml` awareness | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟡 High | Add `modulesManifestPath` field to schema; `consolidate.py` reads it in Phase 4 |
| Dual cross-repo config schemas not documented | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟡 High | Document split: `akr-config-schema.json` = participation; `consolidation-config-schema.json` = execution |
| `project_type` not in existing `requiredTags` | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟡 High | Update `akr-config-schema.json` `validation.tagValidation.requiredTags` in Phase 1 |
| `humanInput` schema not aligned with ❓ HITL model | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟠 Medium | Cross-reference `defaultRole` enum against template "who provides it" column in Phase 1 |
| `warnOnMissingLayers` not recognized as existing logic | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟠 Medium | `consolidate.py` reads existing flag; document as read-not-implement |
| `monitoring` schema unused during pilot | Review 6 (Schema Audit) | 🟠 Medium | Enable in pilot `.akr-config.json` for Phase 0 generation-time baseline |
| `/docs.interview` original purpose not preserved in migration narrative | Workflow clarification | 🟠 Medium | Document as historical HITL command for unresolved `❓`; map replacement to Agent Skill Mode C |
| `copilot-instructions.md` rewrite scope underestimated | Review 7 (File Inspection) | 🔴 Blocking for Phase 1 | Full document replacement (~3–4 hours); only Core Principles, completeness scoring, and Vale gate reference are retained |
| `validate-documentation.yml` already exists and calls `validate_documentation.py` | Review 7 (File Inspection) | 🟡 High | Phase 1 CI task is ADAPT not BUILD; four targeted changes only |
| `tag-registry.json` PascalCase vs. free-text `feature` field mismatch | Review 7 (File Inspection) | 🔴 Blocking for pilot | Fix `feature` field to PascalCase in `modules.yaml`; add `CourseCatalogManagement` entry in Phase 0 |
| Agent Skill may not invoke in Copilot (GPT-4o): silent non-invocation, partial execution, context bypass | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) | 🔴 Blocking — skill is the primary workflow encoding; ungoverned invocation means governance contracts are unenforced | Three-layer stack: (1) `disable-model-invocation: true` frontmatter + `/akr-docs` slash-command only; (2) session hooks (`postToolUse` + `agentStop`); (3) `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header as in-document proof-of-execution checked by validator |
| Agent Skill execution quality varies by LLM: GPT-4o ~75% pass rate vs. Claude Sonnet ≥90%; Mode B truncation on large modules under GPT-4o | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) | 🟡 High — affects output completeness; CI gate catches gaps but developers need early warning | `SKILL-COMPAT.md` companion file documents model-specific failure modes; `evals/benchmark.json` tracks pass rates; `copilot-instructions.md` includes model compat note; CI gate is model-agnostic backstop |
| No pre-production skill eval framework: no baseline pass rates, no regression detection after model updates | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) | 🟡 High — without baseline, model updates silently degrade skill performance between phases | `evals/` directory with `cases/` (3 YAML assertion files) + `benchmark.json`; eval cases run during pre-pilot Tests 1 and 3; results populate Phase 1 baseline; re-run before Phase 4 |
| Vale working-directory path resolution bug in `review/validate-documentation.yml` | CL 41 Architectural Review | 🟡 High — vale step runs `cd ~/.akr/templates` then invokes vale with workspace-relative `$DOC_FILES` paths; files are not found from the templates directory; vale exits without validating any documents (silent failure) | Use absolute `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/` prefix on `$DOC_FILES` entries, OR run vale from workspace root and pass absolute config: `vale --config ~/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini $DOC_FILES`; do not `cd` into the templates directory before the vale invocation |
| Custom vale rules handling gap in Migration Guide Step 2 | CL 41 Architectural Review | 🟠 Medium — Migration Guide instructs teams to delete all files in `validation/vale-rules/` without distinguishing AKR-distributed rules (safe to delete) from team-custom rules (must be preserved); teams with custom rules risk deleting them | Update Migration Guide Step 2 to split instructions: (1) delete AKR-distributed rules under `validation/vale-rules/AKR/`; (2) if team-custom rules exist under `validation/vale-rules/` outside `AKR/`, relocate to `.akr/vale-rules/custom/` before deleting the `validation/vale-rules/` directory |

## Part 13: The Optimal Implementation Path — Final

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 0 — Prerequisites (1–2 weeks) BLOCKING GATE
Everything in Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1 begins.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Charter Compression (prerequisite for Pre-Pilot Test 1):
  □ Create copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md
    Target: ~2,500 tokens. Source: AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md.
    Preserve: required sections, YAML fields, marker syntax,
    module-level section requirements, quality thresholds.
  □ Create copilot-instructions/ui-component.instructions.md
    Target: ~2,500 tokens. Source: AKR_CHARTER_UI.md.
  □ Create copilot-instructions/database.instructions.md
    Target: ~1,500 tokens. Source: AKR_CHARTER_DB.md.
  □ Full charters remain in charters/ — reference only.

Agent Skill Authoring (prerequisite for Phase 2.5):
  □ Create .github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md with Mode A + Mode B + Mode C.
    Use the three-mode specification from Part 5 of this document.
    Reference condensed charters (not full charters) in Mode B step 2.
  □ Add YAML frontmatter block above <!-- SKILL_VERSION --> comment:
    - disable-model-invocation: true (prevents silent auto-invocation)
    - optimized-for: claude-sonnet-4-6
    - tested-on: [claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-4o] with pass-rate annotations
    (See Part 16 for rationale and failure modes this prevents.)
  □ Add self-reporting CRITICAL block as first SKILL body instruction.
    Required text: "CRITICAL: When this skill is loaded, begin EVERY response
    with: ✅ akr-docs INVOKED AND STEPS EXECUTED — Steps followed: ..."
  □ Add <!-- akr-generated --> metadata header write as final step of Mode B.
    See Part 5 Mode B step 8 for required field list.
  □ Create SKILL-COMPAT.md skeleton at .github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL-COMPAT.md.
    Model compatibility matrix rows; populate with Phase 0 eval results.

Skill Evaluation Framework (prerequisite for Phase 1 baseline):
  □ Create evals/ directory structure in core-akr-templates:
    evals/cases/mode-a-standard.yaml      (assertions matching Test 1 criteria)
    evals/cases/mode-b-coursedomain.yaml  (assertions vs. courses_service_doc.md)
    evals/cases/mode-b-large-module.yaml  (8-file stress test; no truncation)
    evals/datasets/coursedomain-files/    (input files for eval cases)
    evals/benchmark.json                  (null baseline; populated after Tests 1+3)
  □ Run eval cases during Pre-pilot Tests 1 and 3 (no additional time cost).
    Record pass rates and token counts for claude-sonnet-4-6 and gpt-4o.
  □ Populate SKILL-COMPAT.md v1.0 skeleton with Phase 0 eval results.
  Gate: mode-b-coursedomain.yaml requires condensed backend charter first.

modules.yaml Schema Definition:
  □ Define complete schema per Part 4 of this document.
  □ Create core-akr-templates/examples/modules.yaml with:
    - TrainingTracker.Api example (CourseDomain + training.Courses)
    - UI project example (CourseManagementUI)
    - Both modules[] and database_objects[] sections shown

Infrastructure Audit:
  □ Audit .akr/workflows/ — two workflows confirmed (Review 7):
    1. validate-documentation.yml — PRIMARY MIGRATION TARGET
       Already calls validate_documentation.py at core-akr-templates/main/scripts/
       Already runs Vale with .akr/.vale.ini config
       Already uses tj-actions/changed-files@v41 for diff
       Already has Checks API permissions
       → Phase 1 task: ADAPT this workflow; do not rebuild from scratch
    2. distribute-tag-registry.yml — RETAIN AND LEVERAGE
       Triggers on tag-registry.json changes; validates against tag-registry-schema.json;
       distributes to application repos automatically
       → Phase 4 task: assess whether tag-registry.json can be evolved into
         feature-registry.yaml rather than creating a parallel file
  □ Add CourseCatalogManagement (and other pilot feature tags) to tag-registry.json.
    distribute-tag-registry.yml will auto-distribute on commit.
    Do this before pilot modules.yaml is authored.
  □ Extended migration inventory:
    - git grep -l '\.akr/' (repository paths)
    - CI/CD pipeline configs (Azure DevOps / GitHub Actions)
    - Deployment scripts (*.ps1, *.sh) referencing .akr/ or old script names
    - External config management tools
    - .gitmodules references
  □ Narrow TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json to templateId→version registry only.
    Document deprecated roles in CHANGELOG.

Cost Modeling:
  □ Model premium request consumption for Copilot agent mode + coding agent.
    Use GitHub billing dashboard + M365 Agent Usage Estimator.
    Establish monthly budget baseline and alert threshold.
  □ Enable monitoring in pilot project's .akr-config.json:
    monitoring: { enabled: true, trackMetrics: ["generation-time", "validation-results"] }
    This provides a documentation-layer usage baseline at zero additional cost.
    Collect generation-time data across first 10 module documentation runs.

Pre-Pilot Validation Spike (5 tests — see Part 11):
  □ Test 1: Module-level code analysis with condensed backend charter.
  □ Test 2: Hosted MCP context source configuration at current plan tier.
  □ Test 3: Large-module stress test (8 files, 2,000+ LOC).
  □ Test 4: GitHub Actions invocability (or confirm deterministic fallback).
  □ Test 5: Data governance and legal compliance sign-off.
  GATE: All 5 tests pass or have documented fallback architectures.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 1 — Foundation (3–5 weeks)
Target: core-akr-templates v1.0.0 release tag.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Template Adaptation:
  □ Adapt lean_baseline_service_template.md → module variant.
    Add: Module Files section, Operations Map, full-stack architecture
    diagram instructions, module-scope YAML front matter.
    Acceptance criterion: output matches courses_service_doc.md structure.
  □ Adapt ui_component_template.md → module variant.
    Add: Module Files section, component hierarchy diagram.
  □ Retain table_doc_template.md and embedded_database_template.md as-is.
    These are Level 2 templates; no module-scope changes needed.

copilot-instructions.md Rewrite:
  □ Remove: MCP server tool invocations, Tree-sitter references,
    VSCODE_WORKSPACE_FOLDER references, file-centric template selection.
  □ Replace with: module-centric template selection table (Part 7).
    project_type → charter → template mapping.
  □ Add: module grouping principles (domain noun, dependency graph,
    DTO alignment, interface/implementation pairs).

validate_documentation.py v1.0:
  □ Implement full v1.0 scope per Part 6 of this document.
    Realistic estimate: 500–650 lines.
    Declared dependency: pyyaml.
  □ Add <!-- akr-generated --> metadata header check to validate_documentation.py.
    MODULE docs fail with: "AKR metadata header missing — skill may not have
    been properly invoked. Re-run using /akr-docs mode-b [module]."
    (Part 6 addition — this is v1.0 scope, not deferred.)
  □ Module-type-aware validation (reads modules.yaml).
  □ modules.yaml schema validation (9 validation rules).
  □ MODULE vs. DB_OBJECT vs. UNKNOWN doc classification.
  □ Transparency marker checks (🤖, ❓, DEFERRED).
  □ compliance_mode enforcement (pilot/production).
  □ minimum_standards_version check.
  □ --fail-on=never|needs|all flag.
  □ Fallback: modules.yaml absent → warn + generic rules only.
  □ Port test assertions from test_validation_library.py as unit tests.
  □ Cross-platform testing: Ubuntu (Actions), macOS, Windows.
  □ Author .github/hooks/postToolUse.json (audit logger).
    Logs file writes to .akr/logs/session-YYYYMMDD.jsonl during agent sessions.
  □ Author .github/hooks/agentStop.json (auto-validation gate).
    Runs validate_documentation.py automatically when agent session ends.
    Handles missing modules.yaml gracefully (skip, do not fail).
  □ Add .akr/logs/ to .gitignore.
  □ Include .github/hooks/ in distribute-skill.yml distribution bundle
    alongside SKILL.md and SKILL-COMPAT.md.
  □ Run Phase 1 eval suite after SKILL.md is authored:
    Execute evals/cases/ against current model versions.
    Populate benchmark.json v1.0 baseline.
    Update SKILL-COMPAT.md v1.0 with model matrix values.

CI Workflow (adapt existing — do not rebuild the workflow; create the missing script):
  □ Author .akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py in core-akr-templates (Phase 1 deliverable).
    Location: `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` (canonical location in governance subtree).
    Scope: ~500–650 lines; full implementation per Part 6 requirements.
    Implementation: Days 2–4 of Phase 1; unblocked after charter compression begins.
    Acceptance criteria: All tests in test_pipeline_e2e.py pass; all MODULE-required sections detected;
    database_objects[] type detection working; modules.yaml validation working.
  □ Migrate .akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml to validation/workflows/.
    This workflow already:
    - Attempts to download validate_documentation.py from a broken URL (404 — will be fixed below)
    - Installs Vale v2.29.0
    - Runs changed-files detection (tj-actions/changed-files@v41)
    - Has Checks API permissions configured
  □ Adaptations required (five changes total):
    1. Add pyyaml to pip install step
       (current: pip install --no-cache-dir requests)
       (new:     pip install --no-cache-dir requests pyyaml)
    2. **Fix the script download URL** (currently 404)
       (current: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/scripts/validate_documentation.py)
       (new:     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py)
    3. Add modules.yaml to paths: trigger
       (current: docs/**, src/**, .akr-config.json)
       (new:     docs/**, src/**, .akr-config.json, modules.yaml)
    4. Add --module-name flag support to the Run AKR validation step
       (pass project root so script can locate modules.yaml)
    5. Update Vale config path from .akr/.vale.ini to validation/.vale.ini
       (after .akr/ → validation/ directory migration)
    6. Verify that validate_documentation.py v1.0's JSON output structure matches
       the field names expected by the existing jq queries in the workflow's
       downstream steps (.summary.total_errors, .summary.total_warnings,
       .summary.average_completeness). Preserve these exact field names in v1.0's
       --output json schema to ensure compatibility with existing CI logic.
    7. Fix Vale working-directory path resolution bug (CL 41 finding): when review
       `validate-documentation.yml` runs `cd ~/.akr/templates` before invoking vale,
       the `$DOC_FILES` variable contains workspace-relative paths (e.g., `docs/modules/foo.md`)
       that will not resolve from the templates directory — vale silently finds no files.
       Fix: prefix `$DOC_FILES` entries with `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/` to produce absolute paths,
       OR run vale from the workspace root and pass an absolute config path:
       `vale --config ~/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini $DOC_FILES`
       Do not run `cd ~/.akr/templates` before the vale invocation step.

Skill Distribution — `distribute-skill.yml` v1.1.0 Update (CL 41):
  □ Update `.github/workflows/distribute-skill.yml` in core-akr-templates.
    Scope restriction (remove from distribution):
    - Remove `validation/vale-rules/**` from the distributed artifact list
    - Remove `validation/.vale.ini` from the distributed artifact list
    - Add explicit exclusion comment for `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
      (must never be replaced by distribution; team owns their charter pointer)
    Scope addition (add to distribution):
    - Add `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/` directory (akr-groupings.md,
      akr-generate.md, akr-resolve.md) as PATH B/C fallback bundle
    PR body update:
    - Update the "Bundle includes" list to reflect v1.1.0 artifacts:
      SKILL.md, SKILL-COMPAT.md, scripts/akr-*.md, postToolUse.json, agentStop.json
    - Add "NOT Updated (by design)" section explaining vale rules exclusion rationale
  □ Ensure `review/distribute-skill.yml` (from review/ folder) is the basis for this update.
    The review version already implements these scope restrictions — verify then promote to
    `.github/workflows/distribute-skill.yml`. Do NOT use the current production version as base.
  Gate: distribute-skill.yml update must be done before any v1.1.0 distribution PRs are opened.

Governance Policies:
  □ compliance_mode graduation criteria documented:
    Trigger: zero ❓ markers in production for 4 consecutive weeks.
    Approval: standards team lead sign-off.
    Artifact: CHANGELOG entry with date and approver.
  □ TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json narrowed and CI check implemented:
    CI validates that Agent Skill references valid templateId values.
  □ Tag Registry Feature Entry Requirements:
    Document that new entries to tag-registry.json require the following
    fields in the governance section: approved, domain, description, owner,
    status (all required). Optional but recommended: synonyms, relatedFeatures,
    addedDate. Validate entries against tag-registry-schema.json patternProperties
    regex (^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$) before distribution.

Schema Deliverables (new — required before validate_documentation.py can reference schemas):
  □ Author .akr/schemas/modules-schema.json (alongside existing akr-config-schema.json,
    tag-registry-schema.json, and consolidation-config-schema.json).
    Define complete modules.yaml schema per Part 4 of this document.
    Include: project section, modules[] array, database_objects[] array,
    unassigned[] array. Layer enum mirrors akr-config-schema.json projectInfo.layer.
  □ Update akr-config-schema.json validation.tagValidation.requiredTags:
    Add project_type as a conditional required tag for MODULE-type documents.
    Document the conditionality: required when doc_type = MODULE; not required
    for DB_OBJECT or UNKNOWN docs.

HITL Alignment:
  □ Cross-reference akr-config-schema.json humanInput.defaultRole enum against
    the "who provides it" column in adapted templates:
    - technical_lead → Level 1 grouping validation + architecture review
    - developer      → Level 2 content review (fills ❓ sections)
    - product_owner  → Phase 4 narrative refinement
    - qa_tester      → Copilot Studio approval gate (Phase 3+)
    This ensures validate_documentation.py can eventually read humanInput.priorityFilter
    to distinguish blocking (critical) from advisory (optional) ❓ markers.

Release:
  □ Tag core-akr-templates v1.0.0.
  □ Publish release notes documenting scope and migration from .akr/ paths.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2 — Pilot Project Onboarding (1–2 weeks per project)
Target: One project end-to-end; CI gate live; retrospective complete.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  □ Select pilot project (recommended: TrainingTracker.Api).
  □ Per-project onboarding checklist:
    - Initialize local skill cache via VS Code task or setup script (replaces submodule):
      Run `scripts/setup-local-cache.sh` (or equivalent VS Code task) to clone
      core-akr-templates to `~/.akr/templates/` — same path used by the CI runtime clone.
      Do NOT add core-akr-templates as a git submodule (submodule creates stale-pin risk;
      CI already uses runtime `git clone --depth 1` which is the correct pattern — CL 41)
    - Configure hosted MCP context source (or .github/copilot-instructions.md)
    - Copy .github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md from core-akr-templates
    - Deploy validate-documentation.yml from examples/
    - Create initial modules.yaml (project section only; modules[] empty)
  □ Run Mode A (grouping proposal) on pilot project.
    Review draft modules.yaml PR with developer who knows the codebase.
    Time the grouping validation: target <15 minutes.
  □ Run Mode B (documentation generation) on CourseDomain module.
    Developer present; record time-to-draft.
  □ Open first documented PR; verify CI validation runs correctly.
  □ Test full workflow in Visual Studio (not just VS Code).
  □ Run Mode B on two additional modules independently (unassisted).
  □ Conduct 2–4 week pilot period.
  □ Run pilot retrospective:
    - Time-to-doc per module
    - ❓ section fill rate
    - Validation pass rate on first PR
    - Grouping proposal accuracy (% of groups requiring reassignment)
    - Specific friction points
    - Self-reporting block present rate (target: 100% of Mode B responses)
    - akr-generated metadata header present rate (target: 100% of merged docs)
  □ Document GPT-4o-specific failure modes observed during pilot in SKILL-COMPAT.md v1.1.
    Classify per Part 16 failure mode taxonomy before Phase 2.5 begins.
  □ Update benchmark.json with pilot real-world pass rates alongside Phase 1 baseline.
  □ Update templates and validate_documentation.py based on findings.
  □ Tag v1.1.0 if breaking changes; update pilot project's standards_version pin.
  □ Expand to second project using updated onboarding checklist.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 2.5 — Copilot Coding Agent Spike (1 week)
Gate: Run after Phase 2 retrospective. Go/no-go for Phase 3.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  □ Create GitHub Issue template: "Generate Module Documentation"
    Fields: module name, project name, project_type.
  □ Assign issue to Copilot coding agent.
  □ Agent uses akr-docs SKILL.md + condensed charter from project_type.
  □ Acceptance criteria (from test_pipeline_e2e.py):
    - All MODULE required sections present
    - Module Files section lists all files with correct roles
    - Operations Map covers all operations in all files
    - validate_documentation.py passes with zero errors
    - No section truncation or omission
    - Criterion 9: <!-- akr-generated --> metadata header present in PR output
      (confirms skill completed Mode B in async coding agent context)
    - Criterion 10: .akr/logs/session-*.jsonl hook log present in PR
      (hard gate only if Copilot hook support is confirmed in Phase 1;
      otherwise classify as KNOWN-GAP telemetry, document evidence in
      SKILL-COMPAT.md, and do not authorize Phase 3 on Criterion 10 alone)
  □ Classify Phase 2.5 failures against SKILL-COMPAT.md model-specific failure modes.
    Distinguish: GPT-4o model limitation (cannot fix with SKILL.md edits) vs.
    fixable skill instruction gap (can address with SKILL.md update).
    Only model-limitation failures authorize Phase 3 scope.
  □ Populate benchmark.json coding-agent key with Phase 2.5 pass rates.
  □ Pass → coding agent is the Phase 3 automation layer.
            Document: "Phase 3 custom agent not required."
  □ Fail → Document specific failure modes by section and module type.
            Phase 3 authorized only for the documented failure cases.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 3 — Automation Extension (conditional on Phase 2.5 outcome)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

If Phase 2.5 passes:
  □ Coding agent + Agent Skill is the automation layer. Phase 3 complete.
  □ Optionally: Copilot Studio Doc Review agent in Teams (if M365 licenses
    confirmed and credit budget approved).

If Phase 2.5 fails (specific documented cases only):
  □ Survey Copilot Marketplace extensions (2–3 days) before building.
  □ Evaluate GitHub Actions + coding agent composition before Azure Functions.
  □ If building custom @doc-agent:
    - 350-line review gate; 500-line hard ceiling
    - CI enforces line count on agent repository
    - No logic embedded in agent; all governance logic in core-akr-templates

Copilot Studio Doc Review Agent (if M365 licensing confirmed):
  □ Trigger on PR label: docs-review-required (not every PR)
  □ Approval routing: tech lead, QA lead, product owner, security reviewer
  □ Compliance artifact: approval chain logged per PR
  □ Credit model confirmed via Agent Usage Estimator before deployment

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PHASE 4 — Cross-Repository Feature Consolidation
Gate: Phase 2 stable ≥6 weeks; zero bypass events; all docs tagged.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  □ Assess tag-registry.json vs. feature-registry.yaml:
    distribute-tag-registry.yml already governs tag-registry.json distribution.
    Before creating a new feature-registry.yaml, evaluate whether tag-registry.json
    can be extended with cross-repository participation metadata.
    If tag-registry.json is evolved: update distribute-tag-registry.yml validation rules.
    If a new feature-registry.yaml is needed: it must not duplicate tag-registry.json keys.
  □ Author feature-registry.yaml (or extend tag-registry.json) in core-akr-templates.
    Maps PascalCase feature_tag keys to display names and participating repositories.
  □ Update consolidation-config-schema.json:
    Add modulesManifestPath field (default: "modules.yaml").
    consolidate.py reads modules.yaml first when this field is present;
    falls back to docsPath glob scan for repos not yet onboarded.
  □ Implement consolidate.py as deterministic Python aggregator.
    Config reading split (both configs must be read):
    - akr-config-schema.json crossRepository section: drives participation
      (publishFeatureDocs, relatedRepositories[], sectionMapping)
    - consolidation-config-schema.json: drives execution
      (which repos to clone, modulesManifestPath, output format)
    Document input contract:
    - FOR_EACH_API_COMPONENT: module docs where project_type in [api-backend, microservice]
    - FOR_EACH_UI_COMPONENT: module docs where project_type = ui-component
    - FOR_EACH_DB_COMPONENT: database_objects[] entries
    - Fills feature-consolidated.md template placeholder syntax
    - No AI invocation from Actions
    warnOnMissingLayers: read from consolidation-config-schema.json
    validation.warnOnMissingLayers (existing field — do not re-implement).
  □ Deploy .github/workflows/consolidate-feature.yml in Feature repo.
    Trigger: workflow_dispatch (manual) or schedule.
    Output: structured draft in docs/features/{FeatureName}_doc.md.
  □ Product Owner refines narrative sections with Copilot agent mode.
  □ Test consolidation on 3-component feature end-to-end.
  □ Verify consolidation completes in under 2 minutes (sparse checkout).
  □ Test with real Product Owner and QA lead.
```

## Part 14: Decisions Locked vs. Decisions Still Open

### Locked — No Further Analysis Needed

| Decision | Evidence |
|---|---|
| `validate_documentation.py` must be authored from scratch; download URL must be corrected | Final file inspection: script does not exist; workflow attempts 404 download. New canonical location: `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` in core-akr-templates |
| Charter compression is Phase 0 blocking precondition | AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md at ~11,000 tokens; math is unambiguous |
| `modules.yaml` separates `modules[]` from `database_objects[]` | Module architecture clarification; required for validator and consolidate.py |
| Agent Skill has Mode A (DocumentPlanner grouping) + Mode B (generation) + Mode C (interactive HITL completion) | Workflow clarification + module architecture; sequencing enforced by skill |
| `validate_documentation.py` must be module-type-aware in v1.0 | Module architecture; cannot defer without false positives on module docs |
| `copilot-instructions.md` requires module-centric rewrite | Module architecture; file-centric logic is structurally wrong |
| `layer` (project-level) ≠ `project_type` (module-level) | Module architecture; separate fields, separate validation |
| `consolidate.py` reads module docs as atomic inputs for API/UI | Module architecture; individual component iteration is no longer correct |
| Phase 2.5 before Phase 3 authorization | All reviews; coding agent must be tested before Azure Function is justified |
| Tag-registry and consolidation schemas both exclude `Full-Stack` intentionally | Final audit: both omit `Full-Stack` from their layer enums. `modules-schema.json` will include `Full-Stack` (parity with `akr-config-schema.json`), but tag-registry and consolidation remain as separate governance layers |
| `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` narrowed to version registry | M365 + prior review reconciliation |
| `courses_service_doc.md` is the Level 1 acceptance criterion | Module architecture clarification |
| `modules-schema.json` is a new Phase 1 deliverable (does not exist yet) | Review 6 schema audit |
| `consolidation-config-schema.json` needs `modulesManifestPath` evolution in Phase 4 | Review 6 schema audit |
| Cross-repo config split: participation (`akr-config-schema.json`) vs. execution (`consolidation-config-schema.json`) | Review 6 schema audit |
| `warnOnMissingLayers` is an existing config flag — read, do not re-implement | Review 6 schema audit |
| Agent Skill must use `disable-model-invocation: true` frontmatter; explicit `/akr-docs` slash command is the supported path for interactive use, while coding-agent runs are initiated through issue assignment with Mode B instructions and validated via metadata header checks | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) — three failure modes of auto-invocation confirmed |
| Mode B final step must write `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header; `validate_documentation.py` must check for its presence; absence is a CI failure | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) — in-document proof-of-execution contract |
| Agent Skill execution quality is LLM-dependent; `SKILL-COMPAT.md` and `evals/benchmark.json` are required governance artifacts, not optional tooling | Review 9 (Skill Optimization) — GPT-4o vs. Claude Sonnet variance confirmed; eval framework required before pilot |
| `distribute-skill.yml` must not distribute `validation/vale-rules/` or `validation/.vale.ini`; vale rules must be fetched at CI runtime from `.akr/vale-rules/` in `core-akr-templates` only — a single canonical copy | CL 41 Architectural Review — confirmed 70+ vale rule file instances distributed across workspace; 6 `.vale.ini` files found; duplication creates stale-rule drift and ambiguity about which copy is authoritative |
| Mode scripts (`scripts/akr-groupings.md`, `scripts/akr-generate.md`, `scripts/akr-resolve.md`) are distributed alongside `SKILL.md` as PATH B/C fallbacks for offline and CI contexts; charter content is NOT distributed; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is explicitly excluded from distribution (team ownership preserved; overwrite confirmed in training-tracker-backend) | CL 41 Architectural Review — v1.1.0 dispatcher architecture; copilot-instructions.md overwrite by distribution confirmed by direct file inspection |

### Still Open — Requires Input or Testing

| Decision | Open Question | How to Resolve |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted MCP context source availability | Available at current GitHub Copilot Business tier? | Pre-pilot Test 2 |
| Copilot coding agent premium request rate | What is the per-session cost at team scale? | GitHub billing dashboard + M365 estimator |
| Copilot Studio Doc Review agent | Are M365 Copilot licenses available? | Check licensing |
| `allowWorkflowBypass` default value in `config.json` | Does the dev config ship with bypass enabled? | Code inspection; confirms whether config gate is nominal |
| `copilot-instructions.md` character limit | Is ~4,000 characters sufficient for condensed backend charter? | Test during charter compression |
| Template adaptation acceptance | Does adapted `lean_baseline_service_template.md` produce output matching `courses_service_doc.md`? | Phase 1 deliverable; `courses_service_doc.md` is the spec |
| Agent Skills hooks support in GitHub Copilot | Do `.github/hooks/postToolUse.json` and `.github/hooks/agentStop.json` trigger in Copilot agent mode (not just Claude Code)? | Test during Phase 1 Deliverable 7A; if not supported, document as known gap in `SKILL-COMPAT.md`; CI gate remains the enforcement backstop |
| Charter content migration destination | The `Enterprise Best Practices` (lines 469–935, ~466 lines of C# code) and `Common Anti-Patterns` (lines 1068–1290, ~222 lines) sections from `AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` must be relocated before Mode B runs begin. Should a new file `docs/patterns/backend-best-practices.md` be created to house these sections, or should they be archived separately? | **Decision required during Phase 2 Deliverable 11 (Artifact Normalization).** Once resolved, the charter file path and content destination must be updated in all related documentation (`PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md`, tracking table, validator scope). This is not a governance decision — it is a file organization decision — but it must be resolved before charter compression is finalized or the patterns will be lost rather than relocated. **Proposed action:** Create `docs/patterns/backend-best-practices.md` and use it as the archive location; add a reference link in the compressed charter. |

## Part 15: Summary of What Each Major Input Contributed

| Input | What It Permanently Changed |
|---|---|
| Review 1 (Claude) | Pre-pilot assumptions as blocking gate; version drift policy; Phase 3 infrastructure concern; `max_files_per_module` governance constraint |
| Review 2 (GH Copilot R1) | Context saturation identified; coding agent as Phase 2.5; `test_pipeline_e2e.py` as acceptance criteria baseline |
| Review 3 (GH Copilot R2) | Charter sizes quantified → compression becomes Phase 0 blocking; `force_workflow_bypass` corrected; template count corrected to 10; `.akr/workflows/` asset identified |
| Review 4 (M365 Copilot) | Agent Skills as primary cross-surface workflow primitive; Copilot Studio for non-developer HITL; premium request metering; `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` retention (narrowed) |
| Review 5 (Module Architecture) | Three-tier hierarchy defined; Agent Skill baseline specified (Mode A + Mode B); `modules.yaml` full schema; `validate_documentation.py` scope upgraded; `layer` vs. `project_type` distinction; `consolidate.py` input contract revised; `copilot-instructions.md` rewrite scope elevated |
| Workflow Clarifications (Owner-provided) | Corrected `/docs.interview` purpose as HITL completion for `❓` markers; added Agent Skill Mode C for interactive in-editor completion; made zero-cloud/no-incremental-cost a named architectural constraint; documented original `core-akr-templates` → sync → `akr-mcp-server` design intent continuity |
| Review 6 (Schema Audit) | Four corrections: `modules-schema.json` is new; `consolidation-config-schema.json` needs `modulesManifestPath`; dual cross-repo config split documented; `project_type` not in existing `requiredTags`. Three additions: `humanInput` schema aligns with HITL model; `warnOnMissingLayers` is existing logic; `monitoring` schema enables Phase 0 cost baseline |
| Review 7 (Final File Inspection) | `copilot-instructions.md` is a full replacement (52-line slash-commands section, Tree-sitter section, YAML front matter, directory structure, troubleshooting — all removed); `validate-documentation.yml` already exists and calls the script (Phase 1 CI = adapt, not build; five adaptations including URL fix); `tag-registry.json` uses PascalCase keys incompatible with free-text `feature` field examples |
| Review 8 (Final File Inspection 2) | CRITICAL: `validate_documentation.py` does not exist anywhere; must be created from scratch as Phase 1 deliverable at `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`. Workflow download URL currently 404 and must be corrected. This is separate from workflow adaptation task. Also confirmed: `tag-registry-schema.json` `layers` array and `consolidation-config-schema.json` `repositories[].layer` both omit `Full-Stack` intentionally (separate from `modules-schema.json` which will include it) |
| Module Architecture Clarification | `courses_service_doc.md` confirmed as Level 1 acceptance criterion; module grouping rules; database object separation invariant; template adaptation is multi-file scope, not new sections |
| Review 9 (Skill Optimization) | Three Agent Skill failure modes confirmed and resolved: (1) silent non-invocation → `disable-model-invocation: true` + `/akr-docs` slash command only; (2) partial execution → self-reporting block + `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header contract; (3) LLM execution variance → `SKILL-COMPAT.md` + `evals/benchmark.json` eval framework. Hooks (`postToolUse` + `agentStop`) specified as Layer 2 enforcement. GPT-4o vs. Claude Sonnet 4.6 pass rate delta quantified (~75% vs. ≥90%). Phase plan impact: Phase 0 adds eval framework + SKILL.md frontmatter; Phase 1 adds metadata header validator check + hooks + `SKILL-COMPAT.md` v1.0; Phase 2 adds reliability retrospective metrics; Phase 2.5 adds Criteria 9 and 10 |
| CL 41 — Architectural Review (Review 11) | Confirmed vale rules proliferation (70+ files; 6 `.vale.ini` instances) caused by `distribute-skill.yml` overreach. Identified SKILL.md monolith token inefficiency: 65–77% savings for groupings/resolve modes achievable with v1.1.0 dispatcher + on-demand mode scripts. Confirmed `copilot-instructions.md` overwrite by distribution (training-tracker-backend direct inspection). Identified new bug: vale working-directory path resolution failure in `review/validate-documentation.yml`. Identified new gap: Migration Guide Step 2 is ambiguous about AKR-distributed vs. team-custom vale rules. Recommended submodule removal in favor of runtime clone (CI already implements this pattern correctly). Defined v1.1.0 SKILL.md architecture: thin dispatcher + three mode scripts (akr-groupings.md, akr-generate.md, akr-resolve.md) + PATH A/B/C routing model. |

## Part 16: Agent Skill Reliability — Three-Layer Enforcement Stack

*Source: Review 9 (Post-implementation planning conversation, March 2026)*

This part documents the rationale, failure modes, and resolution for a class of reliability risk that was not visible during the initial seven-review synthesis: **Agent Skills can be invoked without executing, and executed without completing.** Both failures are silent. This section is the authoritative reference for all skill reliability decisions in the phase plan files.

---

### 16.1 The Problem: Three Failure Modes of Skill Non-Invocation

Agent Skills are not enforced execution contracts - they are suggestions the LLM follows when it chooses to. Copilot (GPT-4o) can respond to a documentation request *without* loading `SKILL.md`. Even when loaded, it can skip or compress steps under context pressure. Four failure modes are confirmed:

| Failure Mode | What Happens | Governance Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Silent non-invocation** | Copilot's intent matcher does not load the skill; Copilot responds from general training data | Full AKR workflow bypassed; output looks plausible but has no charter, no template, no compliance markers |
| **Partial execution** | Skill loads but steps are skipped or compressed, especially on large modules | Missing sections; CI gate catches it, but only after PR submission - no local warning |
| **Context saturation skip** | Skill instructions deprioritised when context window is near capacity with source files | Unpredictable step omissions; worsens above 6 files per module on GPT-4o |
| **Bypass gate risk** | `allowWorkflowBypass` configuration allows workflow circumvention without notification | Skill pipeline bypassed entirely; confirmed in `akr-mcp-server` `force_workflow_bypass` config gate |

**Why this matters for AKR governance specifically:** The charter, template, transparency marker rules, and `modules.yaml` status checks are all encoded in the skill. If the skill does not run, none of these governance contracts are applied. A developer or coding agent can produce a complete-looking document that passes a casual review but violates every AKR standard. The CI gate catches this - but only if `validate_documentation.py` knows what to look for.

---

### 16.2 LLM-Dependent Execution Quality

The same `SKILL.md` file is portable across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex CLI (open standard, December 2025). However, **execution quality varies significantly by underlying model**.

| Model | Expected Pass Rate | Primary Failure Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | ≥90% | None confirmed | Primary benchmark model; skill optimized and tested against this model |
| GPT-4o (Copilot default) | ~75% | Mode B truncation on large modules (>6 files); Operations Map most affected | Context window budget handled less efficiently; charter compression critical |
| Coding agent (async) | TBD - Phase 2.5 | Hooks may not trigger in async context | `benchmark.json` `coding-agent` key populated in Phase 2.5 |

**Pass rate source:** Phase 0 eval baseline (see section 16.4). Values are populated after pre-pilot Tests 1 and 3; the figures above are initial targets, not confirmed measurements.

**Consequence for teams:** Most AKR developers will use GitHub Copilot (GPT-4o). The ~75% pass rate means approximately 1 in 4 Mode B runs will require re-invocation or CI-guided correction. This is acceptable for an interactive workflow - it is not acceptable for an unattended coding agent workflow where the failure is not discovered until PR review. Criteria 9 and 10 in Phase 2.5 directly test this distinction.

**Model updates:** GitHub Copilot's underlying model is updated by Microsoft without announcement. A skill that passes at 90% today may degrade silently after a model update. The re-evaluation requirement before Phase 4 (PHASE_4_FEATURE_CONSOLIDATION.md, Skill Re-Evaluation Prerequisite section) exists specifically for this risk.

### 16.3 The Three-Layer Reliability Stack

The resolution is three complementary enforcement layers. Each layer catches failures the previous layer misses:

| Layer | Mechanism | What It Catches | Where Configured |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Layer 1 - Force Invocation** | `disable-model-invocation: true` in SKILL.md frontmatter; interactive runs use explicit `/akr-docs mode-b [module]`, while coding-agent runs use explicit Mode B instructions in issue templates and are verified by metadata headers | Silent non-invocation; Copilot acting without loading skill | SKILL.md frontmatter + issue template contract |
| **Layer 2 - Enforce Execution** | `agentStop` hook auto-runs `validate_documentation.py` at session end; `postToolUse` hook logs file writes to `.akr/logs/` | Silent step skipping; no local feedback before PR opens | `.github/hooks/*.json` - distributed to all registered repos |
| **Layer 3 - In-Document Contract** | `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header as Mode B final step; `validate_documentation.py` checks for presence | No proof that skill ran; unclear which mode/version/steps completed | SKILL.md Mode B step 8; `validate_documentation.py` MODULE check |

**Layer 1 alone** prevents the most common failure mode (auto-invocation mismatch) but does not help if the skill loads and then skips steps under context pressure.

**Layer 2 alone** provides a local feedback loop but depends on hook support in the execution surface (confirmed in Claude Code; Copilot hook support subject to Phase 1 verification - see Part 14 Still Open).

**Layer 3 alone** is the CI backstop - model-agnostic, surface-agnostic, always runs. But it catches failures *after* PR submission. Layers 1 and 2 move this detection earlier.

**The CI gate is the guarantee. Layers 1 and 2 are early warning.**

---

### 16.4 Skill Evaluation Framework

Before Phase 1 pilot begins, a baseline eval suite must establish what "passing" looks like for both supported models. Without a baseline, there is no way to detect regressions after model updates or SKILL.md changes.

#### Directory Structure

```
core-akr-templates/
  evals/
    cases/
      mode-a-standard.yaml         # Mode A grouping assertions
      mode-b-coursedomain.yaml     # Mode B vs. courses_service_doc.md structure
      mode-b-large-module.yaml     # Mode B 8-file stress test; no truncation
    datasets/
      coursedomain-files/          # Real input files; reuse from pre-pilot Test 1
    benchmark.json                 # Pass rates + token counts per model version
  .github/
    skills/
      akr-docs/
        SKILL.md
        SKILL-COMPAT.md            # Model compatibility matrix
```

#### `benchmark.json` Schema

```json
{
  "last-updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "schema-version": "1.0",
  "models": {
    "claude-sonnet-4-6": {
      "mode-a-standard":     { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-coursedomain": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-large-module": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null, "known-issue": null }
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "mode-a-standard":     { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-coursedomain": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-large-module": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null, "known-issue": null }
    },
    "coding-agent": {}
  }
}
```

`null` values are populated after each eval run. The `coding-agent` key is populated in Phase 2.5.

#### Eval Cadence

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| Phase 0 (during pre-pilot Tests 1 and 3) | Run eval cases; populate baseline; no additional time cost |
| Phase 1 (after SKILL.md is authored) | Re-run suite; confirm baseline holds with new frontmatter |
| Phase 2 (after pilot retrospective) | Update with real-world pilot pass rates; note delta from synthetic baseline |
| Phase 2.5 (after coding agent test cases) | Populate `coding-agent` key |
| Phase 4 (before documentation runs begin) | Re-run full suite; check for model update regressions |

---

### 16.5 `SKILL-COMPAT.md` - Model Compatibility Matrix

`SKILL-COMPAT.md` is a companion governance file maintained alongside `SKILL.md`. It is distributed to all registered repositories via `distribute-skill.yml`. Its purpose is to give developers the information they need to invoke the skill correctly and to diagnose failures without filing support tickets.

#### Content Requirements

- **Model compatibility matrix:** Pass rates per eval case per model; sourced from `benchmark.json`
- **Known failure modes per model:** Specific failure patterns with descriptions (e.g., "GPT-4o truncates Operations Map on modules with >6 files")
- **Recommended workarounds:** Per-model prompt adjustments (e.g., "For large modules on Copilot, invoke Mode B twice - first for Module Files + Operations Map, second for Business Rules + Data Operations")
- **Re-evaluation policy:** *"Re-run evals/cases/ after any SKILL.md change or after a GitHub Copilot model update notification."*

#### Version Correspondence

`SKILL-COMPAT.md` version must correspond to the `SKILL_VERSION` in `SKILL.md`. When a new skill version is distributed, `SKILL-COMPAT.md` is also updated (or noted as unchanged if no model compatibility changes occurred).

### 16.6 Developer Quick Reference - Correct Invocation in Copilot

| Action | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Start Mode A (grouping proposal) | `/akr-docs mode-a [project path]` | Always use explicit command; never rely on natural language auto-discovery |
| Start Mode B (doc generation) | `/akr-docs mode-b [module name]` | Same |
| Start Mode C (HITL completion) | `/akr-docs mode-c [doc path]` | Same |
| Verify skill is discovered | `/skills` in Copilot Chat | Confirms `akr-docs` is in the Configure Skills menu |
| Confirm invocation | First response line: `✅ akr-docs INVOKED AND STEPS EXECUTED` | If missing, retry with explicit `/akr-docs` command before proceeding |
| Check local validation | `.akr/logs/last-validation.json` | Written by `agentStop` hook at session end; check before opening PR |
| Confirm proof-of-execution | `<!-- akr-generated -->` block at top of output document | Required; CI fails if absent |

**If the self-reporting block is absent from a response:**
1. Check `/skills` to confirm `akr-docs` is enabled and not disabled
2. Retry with explicit: `/akr-docs mode-b [module name]`
3. If still absent: note as skill reliability event; check `SKILL-COMPAT.md` for known model-specific workarounds
4. CI `validate_documentation.py` will catch any output structure gaps regardless - do not merge without CI passing

---

### 16.7 Relationship to Existing Architecture Decisions

This part does not change any existing architecture decision. It adds an enforcement layer *on top of* the existing design:

| Existing Decision | Review 9 Addition |
|---|---|
| Agent Skills as primary workflow encoding (Part 10) | Three-layer enforcement stack ensures the encoding is *actually executed* |
| `validate_documentation.py` as CI gate (Part 6) | Metadata header check added to MODULE doc rules; catches skill non-completion |
| Charter compression as Phase 0 blocking precondition (Part 3) | GPT-4o context budget is the reason this is even more critical - less context headroom means more truncation risk |
| Pre-pilot Tests 1 and 3 (Part 11) | Eval cases run during these tests; self-reporting block and metadata header are now pass criteria |
| Phase 2.5 binary coding agent test (PHASE_2_5) | Criteria 9 and 10 added; async context is where Layer 2 (hooks) may not function |
| Zero cloud infrastructure constraint (Part 10) | Hooks are JSON config files in `.github/`; eval cases are YAML files; `benchmark.json` is a text file - zero infrastructure cost |

---

## Part 17: Agent Skills SDK Update - Validated Addendum (March 2026)

**Date reviewed:** March 2026  
**Source reviewed:** *What's New in Agent Skills: Code Skills, Script Execution, and Approval for Python* (March 13, 2026)  
**Review type:** Post-initial-analysis addendum, validated against current repository state

### 17.1 Why This Was Reviewed Now

This SDK release introduced primitives that align directly with Phase 3 conditional design decisions (custom `@doc-agent` path) and Phase 4 governance concerns (side-effect gating). Because these phases are decision-gated and not yet locked by infrastructure deployment, evaluating this release now has low cost and high downside prevention value.

### 17.2 Relevance to AKR (Validated)

| SDK Capability | AKR Relevance | Validated Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Code-defined scripts via `@skill.script` + `run_skill_script` | High (Phase 3 Path B) | Adds a no-hosting execution option for deterministic handlers (operation extraction, chunked generation, project type detection) before committing to Azure Functions |
| Script approval via `require_script_approval` | High (Phase 3/4 compliance) | Adds pre-side-effect HITL gate that complements existing PR-level review; maps naturally to `pilot` vs `production` compliance behavior |
| Code-defined skills + `@skill.resource` dynamic resources | Medium (future path) | Strong option for live standards/version hydration if static charter snapshots prove stale in production |
| File-based + code-defined mixed provider model | Conditional only | Relevant only if a custom Python SkillsProvider is authorized in Phase 3 Path B |

### 17.3 What This Changes in This Analysis (and What It Does Not)

**Changes adopted here:**

1. Phase 3 option space is formally expanded to include code-defined script execution as a first-class candidate (not just Azure Functions/GitHub Actions).
2. Script-level approval is recognized as an additional HITL checkpoint for write-side effects, especially for production mode.
3. Dynamic resources are documented as an intentional future enhancement path, not an immediate architecture pivot.

**No change to locked decisions:**

- Phases 0-2.5 remain valid as written.
- File-based `SKILL.md` remains the primary delivery mechanism for GitHub Copilot built-in agent mode.
- Phase 3 remains conditional on Phase 2.5 FAIL.

### 17.4 Validation Outcome Against Current Plan Files

The addendum recommendation set is directionally correct, but one statement required correction after repository validation:

| Addendum Claim | Validation Result |
|---|---|
| "Four targeted updates were made to phase documents" | **Not yet fully reflected in current phase-plan files** at time of this analysis update; treat as a recommended update set pending explicit implementation in those files |
| Add `@skill.script` to Phase 3 decision options | **Validated as needed** |
| Add script-approval configuration alignment with compliance mode | **Validated as needed** |
| Track dynamic resources in compatibility planning (`SKILL-COMPAT.md`) | **Validated as needed** |

### 17.5 Recommended Plan-Level Follow-Through (Next Editing Pass)

When phase-plan files are next revised, apply the following in order:

1. `PHASE_3_AUTOMATION_EXTENSION.md`: add a deployment option for code-defined `@skill.script` and evaluate it before Azure Functions.
2. `PHASE_3_AUTOMATION_EXTENSION.md`: add configurable script-approval wiring (`script_approval_required`) tied to compliance mode.
3. `PHASE_0_PREREQUISITES.md`: extend `SKILL-COMPAT.md` skeleton with a "Future Enhancement Paths" table including dynamic-resource hydration.
4. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_OVERVIEW.md` and `PHASE_4_FEATURE_CONSOLIDATION.md`: align risk/stack language with the above additions.

### 17.6 Bottom Line

This SDK update does not invalidate current AKR architecture. It improves the conditional Phase 3 decision tree and strengthens the compliance model with a low-effort, high-leverage addition: script-level approval for side effects. Capturing it now preserves optionality and reduces the risk of committing infrastructure before evaluating lower-cost in-process alternatives.

# Part 18: Section-Scoped Generation (SSG) — Multi-Turn / Multi-Pass Architecture

**Date reviewed:** March 2026
**Review type:** Context window strategy — bridge architecture for charter fidelity under current token constraints
**Appends:** `akr_implementation_ready_analysis.md` as Part 18 (after Part 17: Agent Skills SDK Update)

---

## 18.1 Why SSG Is Being Adopted

The context window saturation problem (Part 3) is currently resolved by charter compression — reducing each charter from ~11,000 tokens to ~2,500 tokens before any source files load. This approach works but introduces a trade-off: condensed charters can lose the nuance and worked guidance that makes them effective generation guides, even when all required rules are preserved.

SSG is adopted as a complementary strategy to charter compression with three goals:

1. **Restore charter fidelity per section** — each generation pass loads only the charter guidance relevant to the section being written, not the full condensed charter for the entire document at once. This enables loading more complete section guidance without increasing total context load.

2. **Provide a defined path to full charter use** — as context windows grow, SSG passes can progressively load larger charter sections, and eventually the full charter per pass, without restructuring the generation pipeline.

3. **Enable background execution** — SSG's sequential pass structure maps naturally to the Copilot coding agent's multi-step task model, allowing generation to run in the background while developers work on other tasks.

SSG does **not** replace charter compression. Both strategies operate together: compression reduces the standing overhead of the charter; SSG reduces the per-section context load by loading only what each pass needs.

---

## 18.2 SSG Architecture — Pass Sequence for Backend Module Docs

The following pass sequence applies to `api-backend` and `microservice` project types. A parallel sequence for `ui-component` follows in section 18.3.

Each pass has:
- A **context budget** (what gets loaded)
- A **charter slice** (which section rules are loaded from the condensed charter)
- An **output** (what the pass produces)
- A **forward payload** (what gets passed to the next pass — summaries only, never raw files re-loaded)

## 18.3 SSG Pass Sequence for UI Component Module Docs

The `ui-component` pass sequence follows the same forward-payload-only discipline as the backend sequence. Pass 2 reads all UI source files; Passes 3–5 operate exclusively on forward payloads.

| Pass | Section | Charter Slice | Source Files Loaded | Forward Payload Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Module Files | Module Files rules | None (modules.yaml only) | — |
| 2 | Component Hierarchy + Hook Dependency Graph | Component hierarchy rules + hook graph rules | All UI source files | Component tree + hook dependency map (~500 tokens) |
| 3 | Type Definition Cross-Reference | Type definition rules | **None** — derived from Pass 2 component hierarchy output. Type relationships unresolvable from the hierarchy are marked ❓. | Pass 2 forward |
| 4 | State Management + Props Flow | State/props rules | **None** — props flows and state shapes are mapped from the component hierarchy and hook dependency graph in Pass 2 forward. | Pass 2 + Pass 3 forwards |
| 5 | Rendering Patterns + Side Effects | Rendering rules | **None** — rendering patterns are inferred from component hierarchy. Side-effect sources (useEffect triggers, API calls) are present in the hook dependency graph. Mark unresolvable patterns ❓. | Pass 2 + Pass 4 forwards |
| 6 | Questions & Gaps + Front Matter + Markers | Marker syntax + frontmatter rules | None (pass forwards only) | All prior pass forwards |
| 7 | Assembly + Validation | — | None (assembled draft) | Pass 6 assembled draft |

Timing targets mirror the backend sequence. Pass 2 is the heaviest for UI modules (component hierarchy + hook dependency graph is the equivalent of the Operations Map).

**UI source re-read override:** If a UI module has heavily type-annotated components where the type definitions are the primary structural guide (e.g., complex generic types that are not representable in a component hierarchy summary), a project-level override is available in `modules.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: CourseManagementUI
  ssg_pass3_source_reread: true   # Authorizes targeted type file re-read in Pass 3
```

The same schema and validator treatment applies as `ssg_pass4_source_reread` for backend modules (see NEW-2 resolution in section 18.8A).

**UI forward payload size targets:**

| Pass | Maximum Forward Payload Size |
|---|---|
| Pass 1 → Pass 2 | File list with roles (~200 tokens) |
| Pass 2 → Pass 3 | Component tree + hook graph: component names, props interfaces, hook names, dependency edges (~500 tokens) |
| Pass 3 → Pass 4 | Type summary: exported type names + shapes (~200 tokens) |
| Pass 4 → Pass 5 | State/props summary: state shapes, prop drilling paths (~250 tokens) |
| Pass 5 → Pass 6 | Rendering summary: render patterns, side-effect sources (~200 tokens) |
| Pass 6 → Pass 7 | Full assembled draft (no token limit — this is the document) |

---

## 18.4 Forward Payload Design — Preventing Context Re-Expansion

The most critical SSG discipline is the **forward payload rule**: each pass hands off a **condensed summary** of its output to the next pass — never the raw source files, never the full output text.

This rule prevents context re-expansion, where earlier passes accumulate in later context windows and recreate the saturation problem SSG is meant to solve.

**Forward payload size targets:**

| Pass | Maximum Forward Payload Size |
|---|---|
| Pass 1 → Pass 2 | File list with roles only (~200 tokens) |
| Pass 2 → Pass 3 | Operations table: names, signatures, file origins (~500 tokens) |
| Pass 3 → Pass 4 | Architecture summary: one paragraph (~150 tokens) |
| Pass 4 → Pass 5 | Business rules: rule names + brief rationale (~300 tokens) |
| Pass 5 → Pass 6 | Data operations: tables touched, read/write pattern names (~200 tokens) |
| Pass 6 → Pass 7 | Full assembled draft (all sections joined; no token limit — this is the document) |

The Pass 6 → Pass 7 handoff carries the complete draft because Pass 7's only job is final assembly, metadata header writing, and validation. No source files are re-read in Pass 7.

### 18.4.1 @github Tool Call Discipline in SSG Passes

When charter loading uses `@github` tool calls (PATH A in SKILL.md Mode B Step 2), the following discipline is mandatory:

1. **Pass 1 only**: Charter and `modules.yaml` are fetched via `@github` in Pass 1. The condensed charter content is placed in the forward payload as a summary (≤500 tokens).
2. **No re-fetch after Pass 2**: Passes 2 through 7 use only the forward payload summary. No `@github` tool calls are authorized in Passes 2 through 7.
3. **Premium request budget**: Each `@github` tool call consumes one premium request. Mode B SSG budgets exactly 2 `@github` calls per run (charter + `modules.yaml`). Any additional `@github` calls create unbudgeted premium request consumption.
4. **Violation impact**: Re-reading charters or source files via `@github` after Pass 2 negates the context-scoping benefit of SSG and inflates premium request counts. SKILL-COMPAT.md documents this as a GPT-4o-specific failure mode due to model tendency to re-request tools at high pass depths.

This discipline is enforced in SKILL.md via an explicit prohibition block in Mode B Step 2.

## 18.5 SSG and the `<!-- akr-generated -->` Metadata Header

The existing `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header (Part 5, Mode B Step 8) must be extended to record SSG pass execution evidence. This gives the CI gate visibility into which passes completed and whether any were skipped or split.

**Extended header format (default single-pass):**

```markdown
<!-- akr-generated
skill: akr-docs
skill-version: v1.0.0
mode: B
steps-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
generation-strategy: single-pass
template: lean_baseline_service_template.md
charter: backend-service.instructions.md
passes-completed: single-pass
passes-split:
pass-timings-seconds: single-pass=742
total-generation-seconds: 742
generated-at: 2026-03-17T09:23:41Z
-->
```

**Extended header format (SSG with Pass 2 split, invoked via `--use-ssg`):**

```markdown
<!-- akr-generated
skill: akr-docs
skill-version: v1.0.0
mode: B
steps-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
generation-strategy: section-scoped
template: lean_baseline_service_template.md
charter: backend-service.instructions.md
passes-completed: 1,2A,2B,3,4,5,6,7
passes-split: 2A,2B
pass-timings-seconds: pass1=142,pass2a=287,pass2b=310,pass3=98,pass4=213,pass5=117,pass6=134,pass7=89
total-generation-seconds: 1390
generated-at: 2026-03-17T09:23:41Z
-->
```

**Field definitions:**

| Field | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `generation-strategy` | `single-pass` — default Mode B strategy; `section-scoped` — SSG multi-pass when developer explicitly invokes `--use-ssg`; `single-pass-fallback` — system switched to consolidated single-pass during an in-progress SSG run after slow-generation threshold; `developer-elected-single-pass` — legacy value retained for backward compatibility in previously generated documents | Yes |
| `passes-completed` | Comma-separated list of passes that completed. For default single-pass runs, value is `single-pass`. For SSG runs, when Pass 2 is split, records `1,2A,2B,3,4,5,6,7` — not `1,2,3,...`. When `single-pass-fallback` occurred mid-run, records only the passes that completed before fallback (e.g., `1,2A,2B,3`). This allows the validator to confirm both sub-passes completed, not just that a split was attempted. | Yes |
| `passes-split` | Records the split type when a pass was divided (e.g., `2A,2B`). Serves as a flag for the split pattern in case future versions support other split types. Empty string if no split occurred. Not applicable for single-pass runs. | No |
| `pass-timings-seconds` | Per-pass wall-clock time. Keys must match the actual pass IDs in `passes-completed` (e.g., `pass2a`, `pass2b` when split; `pass2` when not split). For single-pass runs, use `single-pass=[seconds]`. Value `unavailable` if the surface does not expose timing. | Yes |
| `total-generation-seconds` | Sum of all pass timings. Value `unavailable` if timing not available. | Yes |

`validate_documentation.py` must check:
- `generation-strategy` is present and has a valid value
- `passes-completed` contains all expected pass IDs: `1,2,3,4,5,6,7` (no split) or `1,2A,2B,3,4,5,6,7` (split). Both `2` and `2A,2B` are valid representations of pass 2 completion — the validator accepts either form.
- `passes-split` and `passes-completed` are consistent: if `passes-split: 2A,2B`, then `passes-completed` must contain `2A` and `2B`, not `2`
- `pass-timings-seconds` is present (value may be `unavailable`)
- `total-generation-seconds` is present (value may be `unavailable`)

---

## 18.6 Generation Time Metrics Framework

### Why Timing Data Matters

Per-pass and total generation time data serves three future planning purposes:

1. **Threshold-based routing** — if a module's generation time exceeds the slow-generation threshold (see section 18.8), it triggers the fallback escalation path rather than silently stalling.

2. **AI tooling evolution tracking** — as model speed and context window capacity improve, timing data from earlier periods allows quantitative comparison. A module that takes 28 minutes in 2026 may take 8 minutes in 2027; the historical record makes this improvement visible and guides decisions about whether SSG can be simplified or consolidated.

3. **Phase 3 authorization evidence** — if Phase 2.5 shows the coding agent is slow on large modules specifically at Pass 2 (the heaviest pass), that is targeted Phase 3 automation evidence for the Operations Map extraction step only, not a reason to replace the whole pipeline.

### Metrics to Collect

The following metrics must be collected during every Mode B generation run and stored in `.akr-config.json` monitoring output and `benchmark.json`:

| Metric | Where Collected | Granularity | Target Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pass_wall_clock_seconds` | `akr-generated` header + `session-*.jsonl` hook log | Per pass | See pass targets in 18.2 |
| `total_generation_seconds` | `akr-generated` header | Per module | ≤1,800 (30 minutes) |
| `pass2_split_occurred` | `passes-split` field | Boolean | False for modules ≤5 files |
| `source_file_token_count` | Logged by skill before Pass 2 | Per module | Informational |
| `charter_slice_token_count` | Logged by skill per pass | Per pass | Informational |
| `passes_completed_count` | Count of `passes-completed` | Per run | 7 (or 8 if Pass 2 split) |
| `validation_pass_on_first_run` | `validate_documentation.py` exit code | Per run | ≥95% of runs |
| `slow_pass_count` | Passes exceeding their individual target | Per run | 0 |

### `benchmark.json` SSG Schema Extension

The existing `benchmark.json` schema (Part 16.4) must be extended with an `ssg` key per model:

```json
{
  "last-updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "schema-version": "1.1",
  "models": {
    "claude-sonnet-4-6": {
      "mode-a-standard":     { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-coursedomain": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null },
      "mode-b-large-module": { "pass-rate": null, "avg-tokens": null, "known-issue": null },
      "ssg": {
        "mode-b-coursedomain": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "avg-pass-seconds": {
            "pass1": null, "pass2": null, "pass3": null,
            "pass4": null, "pass5": null, "pass6": null, "pass7": null
          },
          "pass2-split-rate": null,
          "slow-module-rate": null,
          "developer-single-pass-rate": null
        },
        "mode-b-large-module": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "avg-pass-seconds": {
            "pass1": null, "pass2a": null, "pass2b": null, "pass3": null,
            "pass4": null, "pass5": null, "pass6": null, "pass7": null
          },
          "pass2-split-rate": null,
          "slow-module-rate": null,
          "developer-single-pass-rate": null
        },
        "mode-b-single-pass": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "section-completeness-vs-ssg": null,
          "notes": "Populated from default Mode B single-pass runs; compared against opt-in SSG runs"
        }
      }
    },
    "gpt-4o": {
      "ssg": {
        "mode-b-coursedomain": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "avg-pass-seconds": { "pass1": null, "pass2": null, "pass3": null,
                                "pass4": null, "pass5": null, "pass6": null, "pass7": null },
          "pass2-split-rate": null,
          "slow-module-rate": null,
          "developer-single-pass-rate": null
        },
        "mode-b-large-module": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "avg-pass-seconds": { "pass1": null, "pass2a": null, "pass2b": null, "pass3": null,
                                "pass4": null, "pass5": null, "pass6": null, "pass7": null },
          "pass2-split-rate": null,
          "slow-module-rate": null,
          "developer-single-pass-rate": null
        },
        "mode-b-single-pass": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "section-completeness-vs-ssg": null
        }
      }
    },
    "coding-agent": {
      "ssg": {
        "mode-b-coursedomain": {
          "avg-total-seconds": null,
          "pass-timings-available": null,
          "avg-pass-seconds": {},
          "slow-module-rate": null,
          "developer-single-pass-rate": null
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`developer-single-pass-rate` now tracks legacy explicit single-pass selections from older flows and should trend toward zero as migrations complete. For current pilots, `mode-b-single-pass` captures the default Mode B baseline, while SSG metrics (`section-scoped`) provide the opt-in comparison set. This preserves a quantitative basis for throughput vs fidelity trade-off decisions.

`null` values are populated after each eval run. `pass-timings-available` in the `coding-agent` block is a boolean populated in Phase 2.5 based on whether the coding agent surface exposes per-pass timing.

### `.akr-config.json` Monitoring Extension

The existing monitoring config (Part 12A, Addition A3) must include SSG timing metrics:

```json
"monitoring": {
  "enabled": true,
  "trackMetrics": [
    "generation-time",
    "validation-results",
    "human-input-completion",
    "cross-repo-sync",
    "ssg-pass-timings",
    "ssg-slow-module-events"
  ]
}
```

`ssg-pass-timings` records per-pass wall-clock times for every Mode B run.
`ssg-slow-module-events` records any module that exceeded the total or per-pass timing threshold, for later review.

## 18.7 SSG as a Long-Term Strategy — Assessment

### Where SSG Holds Up Long-Term

SSG's sequential pass structure mirrors how documentation is actually organized. The Operations Map does not depend on the Business Rules being written simultaneously; the Architecture Overview depends only on having the file list and operations already established. This decomposition reflects sound editorial process, not a workaround.

As context windows grow, SSG remains valuable for a different reason: focused, scoped generation produces more consistent output per section than loading everything at once. A model working on one section at a time is less prone to cross-section inconsistency, hallucinated relationships between sections, and token-budget-driven truncation of specific areas.

**SSG is durable as a pattern. The manual orchestration of passes is what gets replaced as AI tooling matures.**

### Where SSG Is Superseded

The following conditions would reduce or eliminate the need for SSG as a context management strategy (though not necessarily as a quality strategy):

| Condition | Impact on SSG |
|---|---|
| Context window reliably supports full charter + full module in one pass (~50K+ tokens effectively) | SSG becomes optional for small/medium modules; remains valuable for quality |
| Copilot coding agent supports native multi-step task decomposition with charter-section routing | SSG passes are automated by the platform rather than encoded in SKILL.md |
| `@skill.resource` dynamic hydration serves per-section charter content | SSG's charter-slice logic is offloaded to the resource layer |
| RAG/retrieval layer over charters is implemented (Phase 3+ Future Enhancement) | Retrieval replaces manual pass-level charter slicing |

These conditions are tracked in `SKILL-COMPAT.md` under "Future Enhancement Paths." When any condition is met, a `SKILL.md` revision is evaluated to simplify or consolidate SSG passes.

### Progressive Restoration Plan

As context windows grow, SSG passes can progressively load larger charter sections according to this restoration order:

1. **First to restore:** Worked examples back into charter slices (currently removed in compression; highest fidelity gain per token restored)
2. **Second:** Explanatory rationale for rules (helps model apply rules correctly in edge cases)
3. **Third:** Full charter section consolidation — multiple related sections merged into one pass (e.g., Business Rules + Data Operations in a single pass)
4. **Final state:** Single-pass generation with the full charter loaded — SSG collapses to the current Mode B single-shot approach, but now with full charter fidelity

This restoration order is documented in `CHARTER-RESTORATION-PLAN.md` (see Phase 0 addition in section 18.9 below).

---

## 18.8 Slow-Generation Fallback — Alternative for Long-Running Modules

### Threshold Definition

A module generation run is classified as **slow** if any of the following are true:

| Condition | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Any individual pass exceeds 2× its per-pass target | Slow pass | Log as `ssg-slow-module-event`; no automatic action |
| Total generation exceeds 45 minutes | Slow module | Trigger fallback escalation path |
| Pass 2 requires more than 2 splits (i.e., 3+ sub-passes) | Oversized module | Developer review required; consider splitting module |

The 45-minute threshold is set above the ≤30-minute target to distinguish degraded-but-acceptable performance from genuinely blocked generation.

### Fallback Escalation Path

When total generation exceeds 45 minutes during an SSG run (`--use-ssg`):

```
SLOW GENERATION DETECTED
Total elapsed: [X] minutes — exceeds 45-minute threshold

Option 1: Continue with current pass sequence
  → Agent waits for current pass to complete before proceeding
  → No action required from developer
  → Recommended if background execution (coding agent) is running

Option 2: Use module splitting to reduce per-pass load
  → Developer reviews modules.yaml and splits the module into two smaller modules
  → Each sub-module is documented separately; docs are linked in a module-group header
  → Requires: re-running Mode A validation for the split; both modules ≤8 files
  → Add `module_group: [ParentModuleName]` field to modules.yaml for both sub-modules

Option 3: Use single-pass fallback for remaining sections
  → Remaining incomplete sections are generated in a single consolidated pass
  → Charter slice for this pass is the full condensed charter (not section-specific slices)
  → Lower fidelity than SSG; more ❓ markers expected
  → Validator will flag this via `generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback` in the header
  → Developer resolves additional ❓ markers in Mode C review
```

**The fallback is not a failure.** A document generated via `single-pass-fallback` for remaining sections is still a valid draft. The `generation-strategy` field in the metadata header communicates to the CI validator and the developer which sections were generated under which strategy, so review effort can be calibrated accordingly.

### Module Splitting Rules

If a module is consistently slow across multiple runs (recorded in `ssg-slow-module-events`), the recommended path is module splitting rather than repeated fallback generation:

- The module must be split into two sub-modules, each with ≤8 files
- Both sub-modules must share the same `businessCapability` tag
- A `module_group` field is added to both entries in `modules.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  - name: CourseDomainCore
    module_group: CourseDomain
    ...
  - name: CourseDomainInfrastructure
    module_group: CourseDomain
    ...
  ```
- `validate_documentation.py` recognizes `module_group` and links the two docs in output
- `consolidate.py` treats module_group members as a single logical unit for Level 3 feature consolidation

## 18.8A Review Findings — Resolved Issues

The following issues were identified during peer review of this document and are resolved here as binding clarifications.

---

### Risk 1 (Blocking): Phase 3 Scope Example 2 Reclassification

**Finding:** Phase 3 currently documents a "Scope Example 2: Chunked Context Processor" defined as:

> *"Failure mode: 'Large modules (8 files) truncate sections.' Root cause: Context window ceiling at ~25,000 tokens. Solution: Multi-pass processing: (1) extract structure, (2) generate per-section, (3) assemble. Lines: ~200 lines."*

SSG's Pass 1–7 sequence is exactly this solution, implemented in SKILL.md rather than a Python code-skill. Since SSG is baked into SKILL.md from Phase 1, "context window ceiling at 8 files" is **no longer a valid Phase 2.5 FAIL condition that authorizes Phase 3's chunked processor**. Leaving both creates two parallel chunking solutions with no decision rule for which applies.

**Resolution:**

Phase 3 Scope Example 2 ("Chunked Context Processor") is **reclassified** as follows when SSG is adopted:

| Condition | Old classification | New classification |
|---|---|---|
| Large module (8 files) produces truncated sections | Phase 2.5 FAIL → Phase 3 chunked processor | SSG handles via Pass 2 split; NOT a Phase 3 authorization condition |
| Operations Map incomplete due to **context overflow** | Phase 2.5 FAIL → Phase 3 chunked processor | SSG handles; not a Phase 3 trigger |
| Operations Map incomplete due to **AST comprehension failure** (model misses private/async methods regardless of context load) | No prior classification | Phase 2.5 FAIL → Phase 3 deterministic AST extractor (Scope Example 1 remains valid) |

**Required edit to `PHASE_3_AUTOMATION_EXTENSION.md`:** Remove "Context window ceiling at 8 files" from the authorization failure modes. Retain Scope Example 1 (deterministic operation extraction for AST comprehension failures) unchanged. Add a note:

> *"Note: Multi-pass chunking for context overflow (formerly Scope Example 2) is handled by SSG in SKILL.md. Phase 3 authorization on context grounds requires evidence that SSG Pass 2 split produces structurally incomplete output even when executed correctly — i.e., the model comprehends the content but cannot produce a complete Operations Map from correct method signatures. This is an AST comprehension failure, not a context failure, and is addressed by Scope Example 1's deterministic extractor."*

**Phase 2.5 FAIL conditions update:** In `PHASE_2_5_CODING_AGENT_SPIKE.md` Deliverable 5 failure mode table, replace:

> *"'Operations Map only 60% complete' → Context window ceiling at ~25,000 tokens → Authorize Phase 3 chunked processor"*

With:

> *"'Operations Map incomplete after SSG Pass 2 split executed correctly' → AST comprehension failure (model misses private/async methods) → Authorize Phase 3 deterministic AST extractor (Scope Example 1)"*

### Risk 2 (Blocking): Pass 4 and Pass 5 Source Re-Read Contradiction — Resolved

**Finding:** The original Pass 4 loaded "domain-logic files only (Service + Repository)" and Pass 5 loaded "DB-touching files only (Repository implementation)" — both direct source re-reads after Pass 2 had already read all files. This contradicts the forward payload discipline stated in section 18.4.

**Resolution:** Applied directly to Pass 4 and Pass 5 definitions in section 18.2. Both passes now operate exclusively on forward payloads from prior passes:

- **Pass 4** uses the Pass 2 operations table (method signatures and file origins) as the anchor for business rule name and description extraction. "Why It Exists" and "Since When" columns are inherently human-supplied and carry ❓ markers — no source re-read is required for those columns.
- **Pass 5** uses the Pass 2 operations table to map database operations (repository method signatures already identify the read/write patterns). Specific DB call details that cannot be resolved from signatures are marked ❓ for Mode C resolution.

If a team finds that business rules extraction from the operations table is insufficient for a particular codebase (e.g., heavily commented service files where the comments are the primary business rule source), they may authorize a targeted source re-read for Pass 4 only, documented as a project-level override in `modules.yaml` with `ssg_pass4_source_reread: true`. This override is not the default.

### Risk 3: SSG SKILL.md Authoring Time — Scope Assessment

**Finding:** The Phase 0 SKILL.md task table provides no time estimate for adding the SSG pass sequence to Mode B. INSERT 3B replaces ~10 lines of Steps 3–4 with an ~80-line structured pass sequence including timing enforcement, forward payload caps, split logic, and fallback escalation.

**Resolution:** The following time estimates are added to the Phase 0 SKILL.md authoring task table (see PHASE_UPDATES.md INSERT 2E for the full task row additions):

| Task | Estimated Time |
|---|---|
| Author SSG pass sequence (Pass 1–7) in SKILL.md Mode B | 4 hours |
| Author slow-generation escalation handler in SKILL.md | 1 hour |
| Author 4 new SSG eval cases (`evals/cases/ssg-*.yaml`) | 3 hours |
| Validate SSG pass sequence against eval cases (3 runs each) | 2 hours |
| **SSG SKILL.md total addition to Phase 0** | **~10 hours (1.5 days)** |

**Assessment:** If Phase 0 is already committed to a 1-2 week timeline, SSG SKILL.md authoring is additive scope. Two options:

- **Option A (Recommended):** Keep SSG SKILL.md authoring in Phase 0, extend Phase 0 timeline by 2 days. SSG eval cases provide coverage that also validates the non-SSG skill flow, so there is partial test consolidation value.
- **Option B:** Defer SSG pass sequence to Phase 1 Deliverable 2 (SKILL.md authoring). Phase 0 establishes charter section heading structure (INSERT 2A) and `benchmark.json` schema 1.1 (OBS-3 below), but does not implement SSG in the skill yet. Phase 1 SKILL.md authoring then includes the full SSG sequence. Phase 0 eval cases are reduced to the non-SSG baseline.

The standards lead must decide between Options A and B before Phase 0 begins. This document does not pre-commit to either.

### OBS-1: Success Metric Clarification — SSG 30-Minute Target vs. Full-Cycle 45-Minute Target

**Finding:** INSERT 1B adds "SSG total generation time per module: ≤30 minutes" alongside the existing "Time-to-first-documented-PR: ≤45 minutes (grouping + generation + review)." These can appear contradictory since Mode A alone can take 10–15 minutes.

**Resolution:** Add the following clarifying note to INSERT 1B immediately after the 30-minute bullet:

> *Note: The 30-minute SSG target covers Mode B generation only (SSG Passes 1–7). It is not the full Mode A → Mode B → review cycle. The existing 45-minute Phase 2 success metric covers the full cycle and remains unchanged. A compliant workflow could be: Mode A grouping validation (10 min) + Mode B SSG generation (≤30 min) + developer review setup (5 min) = 45 minutes total.*

---

### OBS-2: `passes-completed` vs. `steps-completed` Field Name Resolution

**Finding:** The existing `<!-- akr-generated -->` header uses `steps-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9` (the 9 Mode B workflow steps). SSG introduces `passes-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7` (SSG generation passes — a sub-sequence within workflow Steps 3–4). These are semantically different and the validator checks both.

**Resolution:** Both fields coexist with distinct semantics. The header format is:

```markdown
<!-- akr-generated
...
steps-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
generation-strategy: section-scoped
passes-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
passes-split: (empty if no split; 2A,2B if Pass 2 was split)
pass-timings-seconds: pass1=142,...
total-generation-seconds: 1390
...
-->
```

- `steps-completed` = Mode B workflow steps (reading modules.yaml, loading charter, generating, writing, validating, opening PR). This field pre-exists SSG and its validator check is unchanged.
- `passes-completed` = SSG generation passes. This is a new field, only present when `generation-strategy: section-scoped`. The validator checks it only when `generation-strategy` is set to `section-scoped` or `single-pass-fallback`.
- When `generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback`, `passes-completed` records which passes ran before fallback triggered (e.g., `passes-completed: 1,2,3`; remaining sections completed via fallback).

This resolution must be reflected in INSERT 3A's validator rules and in the SKILL.md header format block in INSERT 3B.

---

### OBS-3: `benchmark.json` Schema Version at Phase 0 vs. Phase 1

**Finding:** Part 18.6 changes schema-version from `"1.0"` to `"1.1"` but does not specify which phase establishes `1.1`. If SSG eval cases are committed in Phase 0 (INSERT 2C), the schema must be `1.1` from the start.

**Resolution:** The schema version at each phase exit gate is:

| Phase | `benchmark.json` schema-version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 exit | `1.1` | SSG `ssg` key present with null values; established at Phase 0 even if SSG SKILL.md is deferred to Phase 1 (Option B above). The schema is a Phase 0 artifact; the data is populated later. |
| Phase 1 exit | `1.1` | SSG baseline pass rates populated from Phase 1 SKILL.md authoring validation runs |
| Phase 2.5 exit | `1.1` | `coding-agent` → `ssg` key populated |

The `1.0` → `1.1` bump is a Phase 0 deliverable regardless of whether SSG SKILL.md authoring is in Phase 0 or Phase 1.

---

### NEW-1: UI Pass Sequence Source Re-Reads — Resolved

**Finding:** The original UI pass sequence table in section 18.3 listed source file re-reads in Passes 3 (Type files), 4 (Component + hook files), and 5 (Component files) — the same structural violation as the backend Risk 2.

**Resolution:** Applied directly to section 18.3. The UI pass sequence now follows identical forward-payload-only discipline:

- **Pass 3 (Type Definitions):** Derived from Pass 2 component hierarchy output. Type relationships unresolvable from the hierarchy receive ❓ markers.
- **Pass 4 (State/Props):** Props flows and state shapes mapped from the component hierarchy and hook dependency graph in Pass 2 forward.
- **Pass 5 (Rendering Patterns):** Rendering patterns inferred from component hierarchy; side-effect sources present in hook dependency graph.

The same project-level override pattern (`ssg_pass3_source_reread: true` in `modules.yaml`) is available for heavily type-annotated UI modules, subject to the same schema/validator treatment as `ssg_pass4_source_reread`.

---

### NEW-2: `ssg_pass4_source_reread` / `ssg_pass3_source_reread` Schema Fields Not in Task Tables — Resolved

**Finding:** The override fields added in the Pass 4 fix (backend) and Pass 3 fix (UI) are undocumented schema additions with no task rows to add them to `modules-schema.json`, `validate_documentation.py`, or the `modules.yaml` example.

**Resolution:** The following task rows must be added to Phase 1 Deliverable 3 (schema updates task table). See PHASE_UPDATES.md INSERT 3E for the exact table rows.

Fields to add to `modules-schema.json`:

```json
"ssg_pass4_source_reread": {
  "type": "boolean",
  "default": false,
  "description": "Authorizes targeted Service file re-read in SSG Pass 4 for modules where service-file comments are the primary business rule source. Not recommended as a default. Document rationale in modules.yaml notes field."
},
"ssg_pass3_source_reread": {
  "type": "boolean",
  "default": false,
  "description": "Authorizes targeted type file re-read in SSG Pass 3 for UI modules where complex generic type annotations are not representable in component hierarchy summaries."
}
```

`validate_documentation.py` reads these fields during modules.yaml schema validation and records the override in the validation output summary. The `passes-completed` field in the metadata header records the override as `pass4-override` or `pass3-override` when triggered.

---

### NEW-3: Slow-Generation Fallback Agent Autonomy Clarification — Resolved

**Finding:** INSERT 3C presented Option A (module splitting) as a choice the agent offers, implying it might execute it. Module splitting requires a `modules.yaml` PR through the standards team — the agent cannot do this unilaterally.

**Resolution:** The SKILL.md slow-generation handler is clarified as follows (also reflected in INSERT 3C update in PHASE_UPDATES.md):

- **Option A (module splitting)** is presented as a recommendation for the developer to pursue **after the PR is merged**, not as an agent-executable action. The agent documents the slow-module event and proceeds to Option B automatically in background mode.
- **Option B (single-pass fallback)** is the agent's autonomous path. The agent never waits for a developer decision in background mode — it records `generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback` and opens the PR with a PR checklist note flagging the slow-module event.
- In interactive VS Code mode, the agent notifies the developer before proceeding to Option B, giving them the opportunity to interrupt and manually execute Option A instead.

---

### NEW-4: `passes-completed` Split Encoding — Resolved

**Finding:** When Pass 2 was split, `passes-completed: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7` did not distinguish whether both 2A and 2B completed — the split was only indicated by `passes-split`. The validator could not confirm both sub-passes ran.

**Resolution:** Applied directly to section 18.5:

- When a split occurs, `passes-completed` records the actual execution sequence: `1,2A,2B,3,4,5,6,7`
- `passes-split` remains as a flag for the split type (to support future split patterns beyond 2A/2B)
- The validator accepts both `2` (no split) and `2A,2B` appearing in `passes-completed` as valid pass 2 completions, and checks that `passes-split` and `passes-completed` are consistent
- When `single-pass-fallback` occurs, `passes-completed` records only the passes that completed before fallback (e.g., `1,2A,2B,3`)

---

### NEW-5: `ssg-forward-payload.yaml` Eval Case Verifiability — Resolved

**Finding:** The assertion "Passes 3–7 context does not include source file content (tested by token count comparison)" is not mechanically verifiable in the Agent Skills eval framework, which tests output artifacts — not model execution context.

**Resolution:** `ssg-forward-payload.yaml` is reclassified from an automated eval assertion to a **manual observation checklist item**. See PHASE_UPDATES.md INSERT 2C update for the revised eval case table.

The verifiability proxy used is behavioral: the standards author runs a Mode B eval on a known 5-file module, observes the SKILL.md self-reporting block output for each pass (which lists "Steps followed: …"), and records whether any pass beyond Pass 2 reports loading source files. This is recorded as a binary YES/NO observation in `benchmark.json` rather than an automated assertion. The `pass-timings-seconds` data provides a secondary proxy: if Pass 3 timing is unexpectedly close to Pass 2 timing, it warrants manual inspection.

---

### Design Decision: Single-Pass Default with Developer-Elected SSG

**Context:** SSG's multi-pass sequence improves section-level fidelity, but the context window for active sessions keeps growing due to cumulative conversation state and tool-output carry-forward. In practice, repeated multi-pass orchestration adds overhead in time and premium requests for routine modules. The strategy is therefore inverted: single-pass is now the default, and SSG is an explicit opt-in for large or complex modules.

This default change is based on three operational observations:

1. **Context growth pressure:** Even with condensed charters, multi-pass orchestration incurs repeated pass setup and payload handoff overhead as session context accumulates.
2. **Baseline draft throughput:** For small and medium modules, a single-pass run reliably produces reviewable drafts faster with fewer coordination steps.
3. **Selective fidelity targeting:** SSG remains valuable, but primarily for known-large modules where operation-map extraction and business-rule decomposition benefit from pass isolation.

There are two legitimate scenarios where a developer should opt into SSG:

1. **Large module, known complexity:** The module contains large files, dense operation paths, or complex dependency flow that benefits from pass isolation.
2. **Higher-fidelity extraction required:** The output is expected to be near production-reference quality in one run, and extra generation time is acceptable.

**Decision:** Single-pass is the first-class default in Mode B. Developer-elected SSG is supported as an opt-in (`--use-ssg`) when pass-scoped extraction materially improves quality. This remains distinguishable from system-triggered fallbacks (`single-pass-fallback`) in tracking fields.

**How it works:**
- Default invocation (no strategy flag) runs single-pass and records `generation-strategy: single-pass`
- SSG is invoked via `--use-ssg`
- SSG runs record `generation-strategy: section-scoped` and pass-level metadata (`passes-completed`, `passes-split`, `pass-timings-seconds`)
- `single-pass-fallback` is reserved for in-progress SSG runs that cross slow-generation thresholds and switch strategy mid-run
- Metrics continue in `benchmark.json` under `mode-b-single-pass` and SSG timing keys for quality and throughput comparison

**Guard rails:**
- The SKILL.md includes guidance (not enforcement) on when `--use-ssg` is recommended, so developers can opt in intentionally for large modules
- SSG still carries slow-generation handling (continue, split module, or `single-pass-fallback`) when long-running conditions are detected
- Single-pass remains subject to all validation gates (required sections, marker policy, metadata header presence)
- Pilot retrospective tracks `ssg-opt-in-rate` to assess whether default behavior remains calibrated

**What this does not change:** Output generated with either strategy remains subject to all CI validation rules — required sections, frontmatter, transparency markers, and `<!-- akr-generated -->` header presence.

## 18.9 SSG — Additions Required in Other Parts of This Analysis

The following table summarizes where existing parts of this analysis require additions or cross-references due to SSG adoption. These are the source of the targeted updates in the phase plan files.

| Part | Required Addition |
|---|---|
| Part 3 (Context Resolution) | Add Layer 5: SSG as a fifth resolution layer (after Layers 1–4) |
| Part 5 (Agent Skill Specification) | Keep SSG pass sequence as an opt-in path; add `--use-ssg` flag; define single-pass default; keep forward payload discipline for SSG runs; keep `passes-completed` + `pass-timings-seconds` in the `akr-generated` header |
| Part 6 (validate_documentation.py) | Keep SSG header field validation; keep slow-generation warning; keep `passes-split` handling; keep `single-pass-fallback` detection; treat `developer-elected-single-pass` as a legacy compatibility value |
| Part 11 (Pre-Pilot Tests) | Add SSG timing measurement to Test 1 and Test 3 acceptance criteria |
| Part 12A (Schema Audit) | Add `ssg-pass-timings` and `ssg-slow-module-events` to monitoring trackMetrics list |
| Part 16 (Skill Reliability) | Add SSG execution quality note to LLM-dependent execution quality table; add `ssg-avg-total-seconds` and `developer-single-pass-rate` to benchmark.json schema |

---

## 18.10 Relationship to Existing Architecture Decisions

SSG does not change any locked decision. It adds a generation strategy layer on top of the existing Mode B workflow:

| Existing Decision | SSG Addition |
|---|---|
| Charter compression as Phase 0 blocking precondition (Part 3) | SSG reduces per-pass context load; compression still required to keep each pass within budget |
| Agent Skill Mode B as primary generation workflow (Part 5) | Single-pass is the default Mode B path; `--use-ssg` invokes structured SSG pass sequence when higher-fidelity extraction is needed |
| `validate_documentation.py` as CI gate (Part 6) | Extended with SSG header field validation and slow-generation warning; default single-pass output is still subject to all section and frontmatter rules |
| Three-layer reliability stack (Part 16) | Unchanged; `passes-completed` field in metadata header is an addition to Layer 3 evidence |
| Phase 2.5 coding agent test (Phase 2.5) | New Criterion 11 tests SSG pass sequence completion in async context |
| `benchmark.json` eval framework (Part 16.4) | Extended with `ssg` key per model for timing data; `mode-b-single-pass` key tracks default single-pass quality vs. opt-in SSG |

# Part 19: v2.0 Architecture Reference and Governance Stability Assessment

**Sources:** AKR v2.0 Architecture Proposal + v2.0 Code-Defined Skill Architecture Specification (M365 Copilot, March 2026); Governance Stability Analysis (March 2026)
**Review type:** External architectural input - selectively integrated; not a current-phase implementation directive

---

## 19.1 What v2.0 Validates

The following decisions already locked in this analysis are independently confirmed by the v2.0 proposal:
- Committed draft model (`docs/modules/.akr/`) as single source of truth for incremental updates (Part 18 additions)
- Three-layer HITL governance (script approval -> draft review -> PR approval) as the correct model (Part 16)
- `@skill.script` / Option D as the preferred Phase 3 custom automation path before Azure Functions (Part 17)
- Dynamic resources (`@skill.resource`) as the long-term replacement for SSG pass orchestration (Part 18.7)

## 19.2 Named Governance Architecture — Three-Layer HITL Model

The three HITL layers documented across Parts 16, 17, and the committed-draft additions are named here as a unified model for navigability:

**Layer 1 — Script Approval (pre-execution):** Required before any file-modifying operation executes. In SKILL.md architecture: `disable-model-invocation: true` + explicit `/akr-docs` command. In code-defined skill architecture (Phase 3+): `require_script_approval=True` in `SkillsProvider`. Prevents unauthorized automated file writes.

**Layer 2 — Draft Review (in-editor):** Developer validates committed draft at `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` in VS Code before confirming 'ready to commit'. Decouples semantic content validation from the CI/merge loop. Applies to Mode B documentation drafts; Mode A grouping review happens directly in `modules.yaml`.

**Layer 3 — PR Approval (post-commit):** Tech lead reviews and approves merged diff. Final governance gate before documentation enters the canonical `docs/modules/` tree.

## 19.3 Workflow State Graph — Mode A and Mode B

Mode A states: `COLLECT_INPUTS` -> `PROPOSE_BOUNDARIES` -> **[HITL: DEVELOPER_REVIEW]** -> `APPLY_CHANGES` -> `CREATE_PR`

Mode B states: `DETERMINE_STRATEGY` -> `GENERATE_OR_PATCH` -> **[HITL: DEVELOPER_REVIEW]** -> `FINALIZE` -> `CREATE_PR`

HITL checkpoints are named state transitions, not implied steps. Conditional branches (full vs. incremental) are explicit:
- Mode A: if `modules.yaml` already exists with approved boundaries -> `INCREMENTAL_UPDATE` branch; else -> `FULL_SCAN` branch
- Mode B: if draft_output exists and status is approved -> `INCREMENTAL_UPDATE` branch; else -> `FULL_GENERATION` branch

## 19.4 Surface Compatibility — SKILL.md vs. Code-Defined Skills

SKILL.md and code-defined Python skills serve different execution surfaces. They are parallel patterns, not replacements:

| Surface | Skill delivery mechanism | SDK requirement |
|---|---|---|
| VS Code Copilot Chat (agent mode) | `SKILL.md` at `.github/skills/` | None - file-based |
| Copilot coding agent (async) | `SKILL.md` + issue template | None - file-based |
| Custom Python agent (Phase 3 Path B) | `SkillsProvider` + `@skill.script` | `agent-framework` package required |
| Copilot Studio | Power Platform | M365 license required |

**SKILL.md is not replaced by code-defined skills.** Removing SKILL.md breaks the GitHub Copilot interactive workflow. Code-defined skills augment SKILL.md for deterministic tasks in a Phase 3 custom agent only.

## 19.5 What v2.0 Does Not Change (Timing-Gated)

The following v2.0 components are Phase 3+ decisions, contingent on Phase 2.5 outcome and Phase 2.6 governance stability assessment:
- Python code-defined skills replacing SKILL.md workflow logic
- `@skill.resource` dynamic resources replacing SSG passes
- Workflow engine graph execution

**Do not implement v2.0 Python skills before Phase 2.6 produces its verdict.** Doing so removes the Phase 2/2.5 evidence base that Phase 2.6 needs to make its assessment, and breaks the GitHub Copilot interactive workflow that the pilot depends on.

## 19.6 v2.0 Open Verification Requirements

| Requirement | Status | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `@skill.script` + `run_skill_script` confirmed working in target VS Code Copilot environment | NOT VERIFIED - Phase 0 Test 7 confirmed SKILL.md structure only, not Python SDK execution | Re-run Test 7 with Python SkillsProvider path specifically tested before Phase 3 Path B |
| `@approval_required` decorator vs. `require_script_approval` constructor argument - confirm current API | NOT VERIFIED - potential mismatch in v2.0 spec | Verify against current `agent-framework` package before authoring production code-defined skills |
| `@skill.resource` dynamic resource hydration available and performant on GitHub Copilot surfaces | NOT VERIFIED - Phase 0 Test 2 FALLBACK; Test 7 FALLBACK | Must be confirmed before SSG replacement is authorized |

## 19.7 Governance Stability Assessment — The LLM Variance Problem

A Phase 2.5 PASS verdict closes the coding agent authorization question but does not close the structural reliability question. SKILL.md governance fidelity is LLM-dependent:
- GPT-4o pass rate: ~75% (Operations Map truncation on large modules documented in SKILL-COMPAT.md)
- Claude Sonnet 4.6 pass rate: >=90%
- Model updates happen without announcement and may shift pass rates silently

Code-defined skills solve this categorically for **deterministic tasks** (method extraction, file role detection, draft writing, validation). They do not solve it for **interpretation tasks** (business rule inference, architectural narrative, Questions & Gaps) - those require LLM reasoning regardless.

**Phase 2.6: Governance Stability Assessment** (mandatory, runs after Phase 2.5 regardless of verdict) answers: is the measured SKILL.md reliability ceiling acceptable for production compliance at the intended scale?

Assessment criteria:

| Criterion | Acceptable | Requires Targeted Migration |
|---|---|---|
| First-run CI pass rate (Phase 2 pilot) | >=95% | <90% |
| Operations Map completeness on GPT-4o | >=90% of methods across public and private | Private/async methods consistently missing |
| Self-reporting block absent rate | <5% of Mode B runs | >=10% of runs |
| Post-model-update regression severity | Pass rate within 5 points of baseline | Baseline gap already >10 points |

**If all criteria acceptable:** SKILL.md remains primary; code-defined skills stay in Future Enhancement Paths. Proceed to Phase 3 (if Phase 2.5 FAIL) or Phase 4 (if Phase 2.5 PASS).

**If any criterion not acceptable:** Authorize targeted migration of the specific failing step to `@skill.script`. Surgical replacement only - not full v2.0 migration. Most likely candidate: Operations Map extraction (Scope Example 1, already specified in Phase 3). Migration runs in parallel with Phase 4 and does not block it unless verdict is Full Migration Recommended.

Phase 2.6 migration is authorized independently of Phase 2.5's binary verdict.
