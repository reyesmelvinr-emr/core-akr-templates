# Phase 1: Foundation — Implementation Plan

**Duration:** 3-5 weeks  
**Team:** Standards team (1-2 FTE)  
**Prerequisite:** Phase 0 complete; all pre-pilot tests PASS or have fallback  
**Target:** `core-akr-templates` v1.0.0 release tag

---

## Overview

Phase 1 delivers production-ready infrastructure: module-aware templates, a complete validation script, CI workflows, and schema definitions. This phase establishes the foundation that all subsequent phases depend on—no pilot onboarding can begin until v1.0.0 is tagged and released.

**Critical Path:** `validate_documentation.py` → CI workflow adaptation → skill distribution workflow → template adaptation → v1.0.0 release

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

1. ✅ `validate_documentation.py` v1.0 authored (~500-650 lines); all tests passing
2. ✅ CI workflow adapted (9 targeted changes); validates module docs without false positives
3. ✅ 2 templates adapted for module architecture; acceptance criterion passed
4. ✅ `copilot-instructions.md` rewritten with module-centric logic
5. ✅ `modules-schema.json` authored with complete validation rules
6. ✅ `akr-config-schema.json` updated with `project_type` in required tags and `businessCapability` support
7. ✅ HITL alignment documented; `humanInput` role mapping complete
8. ✅ Governance policies documented (compliance mode graduation, TEMPLATE_MANIFEST narrowing)
9. ✅ Cross-platform testing passed (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
10. ✅ `core-akr-templates` v1.0.0 tagged and release notes published
11. ✅ Skill distribution workflow (`distribute-skill.yml`) operational for registered repos
12. ✅ `DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md` created/updated with HITL alignment, role mapping, and three-mode skill guidance
13. ✅ `VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` created/updated with compliance mode graduation and emergency rollback procedure

**Exit Gate:** All items above checked; external-review reconciliation items closed; Phase 1 retrospective complete; Phase 2 pilot onboarding authorized.

## 2026-03-20 External Review Reconciliation (GH 1)

This section records disposition of recommendations from an external implementation audit against `core-akr-templates`.

### Confirmed Action Items (Required)

1. **Validator schema parity update (blocking)**
  - Add `review` to `MODULE_STATUS_ENUM` in `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`.
  - Reason: schema already allows `review`; validator currently rejects it.

2. **Version floor enforcement (blocking)**
  - Implement `project.standards_version >= project.minimum_standards_version` check in validator manifest validation.
  - Reason: required by Phase 1 governance contract.

3. **Compliance mode graduation enforcement in CI (blocking)**
  - Update `.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` to derive validator fail behavior from `modules.yaml`:
    - pilot -> `--fail-on never`
    - production -> `--fail-on needs`
  - Reason: hardcoded `--fail-on needs` violates pilot-mode graduation behavior.

4. **SKILL metadata and mode wording cleanups (non-blocking, required before final gate close)**
  - Replace static metadata example values with dynamic placeholders for `passes-completed`.
  - Clarify Mode A Step 2 wording to module-scoped approval logic.

5. **SKILL-COMPAT governance appendix (non-blocking, required for Phase 2.6 readiness)**
  - Add HITL role-mapping summary and Governance Stability Assessment seed table.

### Recommendations Marked Superseded / Already Satisfied

1. `registered-repos.yaml` missing -> superseded (file exists in `core-akr-templates/.github/registered-repos.yaml`).
2. `--fail-on` argument missing from validator -> superseded (`--fail-on` exists with `errors|warnings|never|needs|all`).
3. Template adaptation unknown/incomplete -> superseded (module templates and workshop evidence are already present).
4. Legacy v1.0.0-only release framing -> superseded by current operational v1.1.0 baseline.

### Phase 1 Reopened Criteria (Post-Audit)

- [ ] Validator accepts `status: review` and enforces standards-version floor.
- [ ] CI workflow applies compliance-mode-aware fail behavior.
- [ ] SKILL metadata and Mode A wording updates merged.
- [ ] SKILL-COMPAT governance appendix merged.
- [ ] Existing committed-artifact tasks from this plan remain tracked to closure.

## Deliverable 1: `validate_documentation.py` v1.0

### Objective

Create validation script from scratch that distinguishes module docs from database object docs and applies correct section rules per document type.

### Why "From Scratch"

**Critical finding from analysis:** The script does not exist in the repository. The workflow at `.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` attempts to download it from a URL that returns 404. This is not an adaptation task—it is a net-new build.

### Scope

**Realistic estimate:** 500-650 lines with explicit `pyyaml` dependency

**What v1.0 MUST do:**

1. **Module-type-aware validation**
   - Check if `modules.yaml` exists in project root
   - If absent: warn and apply generic rules only (do not fail hard)
   - If present: load and determine doc type for each file being validated
   
2. **Doc type classification**
   ```
   IF file path matches modules[].doc_output → type = MODULE
   IF file path matches database_objects[].doc_output → type = DB_OBJECT
   ELSE → type = UNKNOWN
   ```

3. **modules.yaml schema validation** (9 rules from Part 6 of analysis)
   - `project.layer` in allowed enum
   - `project.standards_version >= minimum_standards_version`
  - `modules[].grouping_status` in allowed values
  - `modules[].files` count ≤ 8
   - No duplicate `doc_output` paths
   - `database_objects[].type` in allowed enum
   - `project.compliance_mode` in {pilot, production}

4. **Section rules by doc type**
   
   **MODULE docs require:**
   - Module Files (list all files with roles)
   - Operations Map (all operations across all files)
   - Architecture Overview (full-stack text diagram)
   - Business Rules (with "Why It Exists" + "Since When" columns)
   - Data Operations (all reads and writes)
  - YAML front matter: `businessCapability`, `feature` (work-item), `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, `compliance_mode`
  - Status semantics rule: front matter `status` is the generated document's maturity field and must not be auto-derived from `modules.yaml` grouping approval state
  - `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header block (presence check; fail with `"AKR metadata header missing — skill may not have been properly invoked"` if absent)
  - SSG metadata validation (when `generation-strategy = section-scoped`):
    - `passes-completed` field present; contains expected pass numbers
      (Note: this is distinct from `steps-completed`, which counts the 9 Mode B workflow steps and remains checked independently. `passes-completed` counts SSG generation passes within Steps 3-4. Both fields must be present when generation-strategy is section-scoped.)
    - `passes-completed` may include override annotations alongside standard pass IDs
      (e.g., `pass4-override`, `pass3-override`). Validator must accept these as valid
      entries and not reject them as non-numeric. Emit INFO:
      "Pass N source re-read override was applied. Verify override is documented
       in modules.yaml notes field."
    - `pass-timings-seconds` field present (value may be "unavailable")
    - `total-generation-seconds` present (value may be "unavailable")
    - `passes-split` field: if present, value must be a valid sub-pass designation
    - `passes-split` and `passes-completed` must be consistent: if `passes-split: 2A,2B`
      then `passes-completed` must contain `2A` and `2B`, not `2`
    - If `generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback`, `passes-completed` records
      passes that ran before fallback (e.g., `passes-completed: 1,2,3`); emit WARNING:
      "Sections generated via fallback strategy. Additional ❓ markers expected.
       Run Mode C to resolve remaining gaps before production compliance."
    - If `generation-strategy: single-pass`, `passes-completed`
      value is `single-pass`; emit INFO (not WARNING):
      "Document generated via default single-pass strategy. Review thoroughly,
       especially Operations Map and Business Rules on large modules. Consider
       re-running with --use-ssg if module has 5+ files or any file >500 LOC."
      Do NOT count this as a `fallback_strategy_count` event.
    - If `total-generation-seconds` > 2700 (45 minutes) and not "unavailable",
      emit WARNING: "Module generation exceeded slow threshold. Consider module
      splitting if this recurs. See CHARTER-RESTORATION-PLAN.md."
    - `steps-completed` check: unchanged from existing validator logic; checked
      independently of SSG fields.
   
   **DB_OBJECT docs require:**
   - Object Definition (schema, columns/parameters)
   - Relationships and Dependencies
   - Usage Patterns
   - YAML front matter: `object_type`, `source`
   
   **UNKNOWN docs:**
   - Apply generic required sections from `lean_baseline_service_template.md`
   - Warn that doc is not registered in `modules.yaml`

5. **Transparency marker checks**
   - Count unresolved `❓` markers
   - Fail on `❓` if `compliance_mode = production`
   - Warn on `❓` if `compliance_mode = pilot`
   - `DEFERRED` markers with justification text → always pass
   - `🤖` markers → informational only

6. **--fail-on logic**
   ```
   --fail-on=never  → exit 0 always; emit warnings to stdout
   --fail-on=needs  → exit 1 on unresolved ❓ in production mode; else exit 0
   --fail-on=all    → exit 1 on any validation failure
   ```

7. **Structured output**
   - JSON format with `.summary.total_errors`, `.summary.total_warnings`, `.summary.average_completeness`
  - Results include `.results[].issues[].line` and `.results[].completeness_score`
   - These exact field names required for CI workflow compatibility
   - PASS/FAIL/WARN per check
   - Summary count
  - List of specific failures with line references
  - Extended output contract fields for SSG:
    - `.summary.ssg_slow_modules` (array of module names that exceeded threshold)
    - `.summary.ssg_avg_total_seconds` (average across all validated docs in run)
    - `.summary.fallback_strategy_count` (count of docs using single-pass-fallback - system-triggered)
    - `.summary.developer_single_pass_count` (legacy count for docs still using developer-elected-single-pass marker)
    - `.summary.ssg_pass_overrides` (array of `{module_name, override_field, value}` for any module with non-default override)

8. **--changed-files support (workflow compatibility)**
  - Reads changed files list from environment (compatible with `tj-actions/changed-files`)
  - Applies validation to all changed docs

9. **--output flag**
  - `--output json` writes JSON to stdout with workflow-compatible fields
  - `--output text` writes human-readable summary

### Preview Mode and Draft Presence Rules

**New CLI flag: `--preview`**

`validate_documentation.py --file <path> --preview [--module-name <n>]`

When `--preview` is passed:
- Runs all validation checks against the file (draft or final)
- Outputs human-readable summary block for Copilot Chat display:
  ── Mode B Preview: {ModuleName} ──────────────────────────────
  Sections present:     Module Files ✅ | Operations Map ✅ | ...
  ❓ markers:           N sections require human input
  🤖 inferred content:  N items flagged
  Validator result:     0 errors / N warnings
  Generation strategy:  {from akr-generated header}
  Review mode:          {full | incremental}
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
- Does NOT emit JSON output (JSON is for CI)
- Does NOT write GitHub check annotations (CI only)
- Exit code: 0 if no errors; 1 if errors

**v1.0 draft presence check (WARNING level - no new ERRORs introduced):**
All new checks added in this update are WARNING-level in v1.0. No existing ERROR behaviors are modified.
- modules.yaml declares `draft_output` but file absent → WARNING: "Draft declared but not found. Run Mode B."

Mode A grouping review happens directly in `modules.yaml`; there is no separate review-sheet artifact requirement in the active workflow.

**v1.0 final doc cleanliness check (ERROR level - enforced at finalization):**
- Final doc at doc_output path contains draft-only fields (`preview-generated-at`, `review-mode`) → ERROR:
  "Final doc contains draft-only front matter fields. Re-run Mode B Step 6a to strip before committing."
This check applies only to files matching a modules[].doc_output path (not draft_output paths).

The validator's final-doc cleanliness rules must be read alongside this governance rule: a final doc may be structurally final for CI purposes while still carrying `status: draft` until document-content approval is completed through the documented review flow.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Implement core validation engine | Standards author | Reads `modules.yaml`, classifies doc types, applies section rules | Days 1-2 (16 hours) |
| Implement `modules.yaml` schema validation | Standards author | All 9 validation rules working; enum checks against schema files | Day 2 (4 hours) |
| Implement transparency marker logic | Standards author | `❓` / `🤖` / `DEFERRED` detection; compliance mode enforcement | Day 3 (4 hours) |
| Implement `--fail-on` flag behavior | Standards author | Three modes working as specified | Day 3 (2 hours) |
| Implement JSON output with exact field names | Standards author | `.summary.total_errors`, etc. match existing CI workflow expectations | Day 3 (2 hours) |
| Implement fallback mode (modules.yaml absent) | Standards author | Warns and applies generic rules; does not fail hard | Day 4 (2 hours) |
| Write unit tests | Standards author | Port assertions from `test_validation_library.py`; ≥85% coverage | Day 4-5 (8 hours) |
| Test cross-platform | Standards author | Ubuntu (GitHub Actions), macOS, Windows PowerShell | Day 5 (3 hours) |
| Document CLI usage | Standards author | `--file`, `--changed-files`, `--module-name`, `--fail-on`, `--output` flags documented in README | Day 5 (1 hour) |
| Add `pyyaml` to `requirements.txt` | Standards author | `pyyaml` listed as explicit dependency; `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs cleanly on all platforms | 15 min |
| Implement `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header check | Standards author | Validator checks for header presence in MODULE docs; fails with exact message: `"AKR metadata header missing — skill may not have been properly invoked"` | 2 hours |
| Add `--preview` flag and draft presence check | Standards author | Flag produces human-readable summary block with review-mode field; presence checks emit WARNING (not ERROR) for declared but absent draft_output; final doc cleanliness check emits ERROR for draft-only fields in final docs; tested against CourseDomain in both full and incremental scenarios | 2.5 hours |

### Test Cases (Port from `test_validation_library.py`)

```python
def test_module_doc_all_sections_present():
    # Module doc with all MODULE-required sections → PASS
    
def test_module_doc_missing_operations_map():
    # Module doc missing Operations Map → FAIL with correct message
    
def test_module_doc_unresolved_question_marks_production():
    # Module doc with unresolved ❓ in production mode → FAIL
    
def test_db_object_doc_missing_relationships():
    # DB object doc missing Relationships section → FAIL
    
def test_modules_yaml_exceeds_max_files():
    # modules.yaml with module exceeding max_files → FAIL
    
def test_modules_yaml_unknown_grouping_status():
  # modules.yaml with unknown grouping_status → FAIL with enum error
    
def test_modules_yaml_absent():
    # Project without modules.yaml → WARN, do not fail
```

### Dependencies

- **Python 3.9+**
- **pyyaml** (explicit; add to `requirements.txt`)
- **Vale** (subprocess call; installed separately in CI)

### Output Location

```
core-akr-templates/
  .akr/
    scripts/                      (NEW directory — must be created)
      validate_documentation.py   (~500-650 lines; NEW)
```

**Note:** The `.akr/scripts/` directory does not currently exist in `core-akr-templates`. Creating this directory and committing the script is part of this deliverable.

### Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 500-650 lines exceeds capacity for standards team | Prioritize critical path; defer `--auto-fix` and `--tier` scoring to v1.1 |
| YAML parsing breaks on Windows paths | Test with Windows-style paths in unit tests; use `pathlib.Path` for normalization |
| Vale subprocess integration issues | Run Vale as separate CI step in v1.0; tight integration in v1.1 |

## Deliverable 2: CI Workflow Adaptation

### Objective

Adapt existing `.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` to work with new `validate_documentation.py` script; fix broken download URL.

### Context

**From analysis:** This workflow already exists and already attempts to call `validate_documentation.py`. It is not a rebuild—it is an adaptation with 8 targeted changes plus compatibility verification.

**Current workflow capabilities:**
- Downloads `validate_documentation.py` from remote URL (currently 404—must fix)
- Installs Vale v2.29.0
- Runs changed-files detection (`tj-actions/changed-files@v41`)
- Has Checks API permissions configured
- Runs Vale with `.akr/.vale.ini` config

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Change 1:** Add `pyyaml` to pip install step | Standards author | `pip install --no-cache-dir requests pyyaml` | 5 min |
| **Change 2:** Fix script download URL | Standards author | URL updated to `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` (not `/scripts/`) | 5 min |
| **Change 3:** Add `modules.yaml` to paths trigger | Standards author | Trigger includes `modules.yaml` alongside `docs/**`, `src/**` | 5 min |
| **Change 4:** Add `--module-name` and `--changed-files` support | Standards author | Workflow passes module name and changed-files mode | 10 min |
| **Change 5:** Fix Vale execution path handling | Standards author | Use canonical config `~/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini`; run Vale from workspace root with absolute document paths (no `cd ~/.akr/templates` before Vale) | 10 min |
| **Change 6:** Remove or replace `validate_traceability.py` download | Standards author | No downloads from `akr-mcp-server` remain | 10 min |
| **Change 7:** Remove or replace `analyze_doc_impact.py` download | Standards author | No downloads from `akr-mcp-server` remain | 10 min |
| **Change 8:** Remove MCP branding from PR comment footer | Standards author | Footer does not mention MCP server | 5 min |
| **Change 9:** Add SKILL file CODEOWNERS guidance | Standards author | Workflow example/docs include `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md @org/standards-team` | 10 min |
| **Verification:** Confirm JSON output compatibility | Standards author | Workflow's `jq` queries work with v1.0 output schema | 30 min |
| **Verification:** Update action versions and changed-files action | Standards author | `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-python@v5`, `tj-actions/changed-files@v44` or latest | 15 min |
| **Verification:** Confirm/deny Copilot hook execution in VS Code agent mode | Standards author | Hook support status documented in `SKILL-COMPAT.md` with evidence (`postToolUse`/`agentStop` logs or absence); if unsupported, Phase 2 onboarding checklist explicitly marks `.akr/logs/session-*.jsonl` as non-gating known gap | 45 min |
| Test workflow on draft PR | Standards author | Workflow runs successfully; validation results appear in PR checks | 1 hour |
| Document workflow customization | Standards author | README explains how projects adapt workflow for their structure | 1 hour |
| Copy adapted workflow to `examples/workflows/` | Standards author | `examples/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` present; matches production workflow; referenced in onboarding docs | 15 min |
| Add `agentStop` hook invocation documentation to workflow README | Standards author | README section explains that `.github/hooks/` directory should also be copied to application repos; notes that `agentStop` hook auto-runs `validate_documentation.py` at session end as local enforcement before CI | 30 min |

### Change Details

#### Change 1: Add pyyaml Dependency

```yaml
# BEFORE
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install --no-cache-dir requests

# AFTER
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pip install --no-cache-dir requests pyyaml
```

#### Change 2: Fix Download URL

```yaml
# BEFORE (404 error)
- name: Download validation script
  run: |
    curl -o validate_documentation.py \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/main/scripts/validate_documentation.py

# AFTER (correct path + branch-safe reference)
- name: Download validation script
  run: |
    curl -o validate_documentation.py \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/master/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py
```

> **Branch safety note (required):** `core-akr-templates` default branch is currently `master`.
> If the default branch changes later, update this URL in the same PR as the branch change, or pin
> to a release tag/ref in the raw URL to avoid fallback drift.

#### Change 3: Add modules.yaml to Trigger

```yaml
# BEFORE
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'src/**'
  - '.akr-config.json'

# AFTER
paths:
  - 'docs/**'
  - 'src/**'
  - '.akr-config.json'
  - 'modules.yaml'
```

#### Change 4: Add --module-name and --changed-files Support

```yaml
# NEW step after changed-files detection
- name: Run AKR validation
  run: |
    python validate_documentation.py \
      --changed-files \
      --output json \
      --fail-on needs
```

**`--changed-files` Contract:**  
Reads space-separated file paths compatible with `tj-actions/changed-files@v41` output format. The script must split on whitespace and process each path as workspace-relative. Example workflow integration:

> **Compatibility note (required):** The legacy `akr-mcp-server/scripts/validation/validate_documentation.py`
> implementation used `git diff --name-only` when `--changed-files` was set. Phase 1 v1.0 must
> **not** reuse that behavior. In v1.0, `--changed-files` means explicit file list input from
> workflow outputs/environment so CI scope is deterministic and PR-accurate.

```yaml
- name: Get changed files
  id: changed-files
  uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v41
  with:
    files: 'docs/**/*.md'
    
- name: Validate changed docs
  run: |
    python validate_documentation.py \
      --changed-files "${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }}" \
      --output json \
      --fail-on needs
```

#### Change 5: Update Vale Config Path

```yaml
# BEFORE
- name: Run Vale
  uses: errata-ai/vale-action@v2
  with:
    config: .akr/.vale.ini

# AFTER (CL 41-aligned runtime fetch model)
- name: Run Vale
  run: |
    VALE_CONFIG="$HOME/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini"
    # DOC_FILES must be workspace-absolute or workspace-relative while executing from workspace root.
    # Never cd into ~/.akr/templates before Vale, or DOC_FILES paths will fail to resolve.
    vale --config "$VALE_CONFIG" $DOC_FILES
```

#### Vale Rules Source of Truth (Required)

- Keep a single canonical AKR Vale ruleset in `core-akr-templates/.akr/vale-rules/`.
- Do not migrate to `validation/vale-rules/` and do not distribute Vale rule files to application repositories.
- CI fetches the canonical rules at runtime from `core-akr-templates` (same model used for validator/script fetch).
- Application repositories must not carry AKR-distributed `validation/vale-rules/` or `validation/.vale.ini` copies.

#### Change 6: Remove Traceability Download

- Remove step that downloads `validate_traceability.py` from `akr-mcp-server`.
- If traceability is required in v1.0, host the script in `core-akr-templates` and update URL.

#### Change 7: Remove Impact Analysis Download

- Remove step that downloads `analyze_doc_impact.py` from `akr-mcp-server`.
- If impact analysis is required, migrate the script to `core-akr-templates` first.

#### Change 8: Remove MCP Branding

- Remove or replace `<sub>Powered by AKR MCP Documentation Server</sub>` in PR comments.

#### Change 9: Add SKILL.md to CODEOWNERS in Application Repos

Include this guidance in onboarding and workflow examples so automated skill update PRs always require standards-team review:

```text
# Add to CODEOWNERS in application repos during onboarding
.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md   @org/standards-team
```

#### Verification: JSON Output Compatibility

**Existing workflow expects these fields:**
```bash
jq -r '.summary.total_errors' validation_results.json
jq -r '.summary.total_warnings' validation_results.json
jq -r '.summary.average_completeness' validation_results.json
```

**v1.0 must output exactly:**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_errors": 0,
    "total_warnings": 2,
    "average_completeness": 0.87
  },
  "results": [ ... ]
}
```

### Output Locations

    workflows/
      validate-documentation.yml   (ADAPTED; 9 changes)

## Deliverable 2A: Skill Distribution Workflow

### Objective

Build `.github/workflows/distribute-skill.yml` in `core-akr-templates` to open PRs in all registered application repositories whenever `SKILL.md` is released via tag.

### Why in Phase 1

Phase 2 begins copying skill files into application repositories. Without distribution in place before onboarding, those copies drift as soon as the next skill release occurs.

### Trigger Conditions

1. Tag push matching `v*` (primary release trigger)
2. `workflow_dispatch` (manual re-run or single-repo targeting)

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author `distribute-skill.yml` | Standards author | Workflow present; syntax valid; tag and manual triggers configured | 3 hours |
| Create `AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` secret | Infrastructure lead | Fine-grained PAT configured in repo secrets | 1 hour |
| Document PAT scope requirements | Infrastructure lead | Security/deployment docs list minimum required permissions | 30 min |
| Test workflow on `TrainingTracker.Api` | Standards author + infrastructure | PR opens with expected skill diff and title | 1 hour |
| Test `workflow_dispatch` with `target_repo` | Standards author | Only selected repo is updated | 30 min |
| Test `fail-fast: false` matrix behavior | Standards author | One failing repo does not block successful repos | 30 min |
| Add per-repo distribution status summary and failure follow-up | Standards author | Workflow summary lists success/failure for each repo; failures create or link tracking issue for stale-skill follow-up | 45 min |
| Add distribution checks to release checklist | Standards author | v1.0.0 release checklist includes distribution validation | 10 min |
| Include `.github/hooks/` in distribution bundle | Standards author | `distribute-skill.yml` copies `.github/hooks/postToolUse.json` and `.github/hooks/agentStop.json` to registered repos alongside `SKILL.md`; PR body notes that hook files must be merged to activate local validation | 1 hour |
| Add mode scripts to distribution bundle | Standards author | `distribute-skill.yml` copies `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-groupings.md`, `akr-generate.md`, and `akr-resolve.md` alongside dispatcher `SKILL.md` (PATH B/C fallback) | 1 hour |
| Enforce no-Vale-distribution policy | Standards author | Workflow does not copy `validation/vale-rules/**` or `validation/.vale.ini`; PR body includes "NOT Updated (by design)" rationale | 45 min |
| Exclude application `copilot-instructions.md` from distribution | Standards author | Workflow explicitly avoids updating `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; policy documented in PR body | 30 min |

### Required Secret

`AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` (fine-grained PAT)

- `contents: write`
- `pull-requests: write`
- `metadata: read`

### SKILL.md Mode B SSG Pass Sequence

Replace the original Mode B generation core with this SSG sequence:

```text
3. Determine generation strategy.

   DEFAULT: Single-pass strategy - generate entire document in one consolidated pass
            using the full condensed charter.
   OVERRIDE: Section-Scoped Generation (SSG) - multi-pass sequence (Passes 1-7).

   Developer may opt into SSG by invoking Mode B with the --use-ssg flag:
     /akr-docs mode-b [ModuleName] --use-ssg

   When to use --use-ssg (developer's discretion):
   - Module has 5+ files or any file >500 LOC
   - Documentation will be used as a high-fidelity production reference
   - The module is at or near the max_files: 8 ceiling

   If --use-ssg is NOT provided (default):
   - Load: All source files + full condensed charter in one context load
   - Generate: Complete document in one pass using the appropriate base template
   - Set in metadata header:
       generation-strategy: single-pass
       passes-completed: single-pass
       pass-timings-seconds: [total time or "unavailable"]
    - Proceed directly to Pass 7 (Assembly + Validation) after generation.
   - No `ssg_slow_modules` event is logged for default single-pass runs.

   If --use-ssg is provided, begin SSG:

   Initialize forward payload as an empty object.
   Record pass start time before each pass (if surface supports timing).

   PASS 1 — Module Inventory
   - Load: modules.yaml file list + module metadata only
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Module Files Rules" section of the condensed charter
   - Do NOT load source files in this pass
   - Generate: Module Files section (each file with its role)
   - Forward payload -> Pass 2: file list with roles (~200 tokens maximum)

   PASS 2 — Operations Map
   - Load: All source files from the module's files[] array
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Operations Map Rules" section of the condensed charter
   - If source file total exceeds per-pass token budget:
       Split into Pass 2A (public operations) + Pass 2B (private/internal operations)
       Record split in passes-split field of the metadata header
   - Generate: Operations Map covering ALL operations across all files
   - Forward payload -> Pass 3: operations table (names, signatures, file origins)
     Maximum size: ~500 tokens. Do NOT pass raw source file content forward.

   PASS 3 — Architecture Overview
   - Load: Pass 1 forward + Pass 2 forward ONLY (no source files re-loaded)
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Architecture Diagram Rules" section
   - Generate: Full-stack text diagram (Controller -> Service -> Repository -> DB)
     No Mermaid. Text-based only.
   - Forward payload -> Pass 4: architecture summary (one paragraph, ~150 tokens)

   PASS 4 — Business Rules
   - Load: Pass 2 forward (operations table — method signatures and file origins
             are the anchor for business rule extraction) + Pass 3 forward
             (architecture summary for layer context)
   - Source files: NOT re-read. "Why It Exists" + "Since When" columns are
     human-supplied — apply ❓ markers. Name + Description columns are derived
     from the Pass 2 operations table (method signatures). No source re-read needed.
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Business Rules Requirements" section
                    (Why It Exists + Since When columns)
   - Generate: Business Rules table (Name + Description from operations table;
     ❓ on Why It Exists + Since When for human completion in Mode C)
   - Forward payload -> Pass 5: rule names + brief rationale (~300 tokens maximum)
   - Project-level override: if `ssg_pass4_source_reread: true` is set in
     modules.yaml for this module (e.g., heavily commented service files),
     targeted re-read of Service files is authorized. Document override in
     passes-completed as pass4-override.

   PASS 5 — Data Operations
   - Load: Pass 2 forward (operations table already contains repository method
             signatures and file origins, sufficient to map reads/writes)
             + Pass 4 forward (business rules for data pattern context)
   - Source files: NOT re-read. If a specific DB call pattern cannot be resolved
     from the operations table, mark as ❓ for Mode C resolution.
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Data Operations Rules" section
   - Generate: Reads/Writes table
   - Forward payload -> Pass 6: table operations summary (~200 tokens maximum)

   PASS 6 — Questions & Gaps + Front Matter + Transparency Markers
   - Load: All prior pass forwards assembled (no source files)
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Marker Syntax Rules" + "Front Matter Requirements"
   - Generate:
       ❓ markers on sections requiring human input
       🤖 markers on AI-inferred content
       DEFERRED placeholders where information is unavailable
       YAML front matter (businessCapability, feature, layer, project_type,
                          status, compliance_mode)
       Questions & Gaps section
   - Forward payload -> Pass 7: complete assembled draft (all sections joined)

   For ui-component project types, substitute the following pass 2-5 sections:

   PASS 2 (UI) — Component Hierarchy + Hook Dependency Graph
   - Load: All UI source files from the module's files[] array
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Component Hierarchy Rules" + "Hook Graph Rules"
   - If source file total exceeds per-pass token budget: split into Pass 2A + Pass 2B
   - Generate: Component tree with props interfaces + hook dependency graph
   - Forward payload -> Pass 3: component tree + hook graph (~500 tokens maximum)
     Do NOT pass raw source file content forward.

   PASS 3 (UI) — Type Definition Cross-Reference
   - Load: Pass 2 forward ONLY (no source files re-read)
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Type Definition Rules"
   - Generate: Type cross-reference from component hierarchy output
     Mark unresolvable type relationships as ❓
   - Override: if ssg_pass3_source_reread: true in modules.yaml, targeted type
     file re-read is authorized; record pass3-override in passes-completed
   - Forward payload -> Pass 4: type summary (~200 tokens maximum)

   PASS 4 (UI) — State Management + Props Flow
   - Load: Pass 2 forward + Pass 3 forward ONLY (no source files re-read)
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "State/Props Rules"
   - Generate: State shapes and prop drilling paths from component hierarchy
   - Forward payload -> Pass 5: state/props summary (~250 tokens maximum)

   PASS 5 (UI) — Rendering Patterns + Side Effects
   - Load: Pass 2 forward + Pass 4 forward ONLY (no source files re-read)
   - Charter slice: Load ONLY the "Rendering Rules"
   - Generate: Rendering patterns and side-effect sources from component hierarchy
     and hook dependency graph
   - Forward payload -> Pass 6: rendering summary (~200 tokens maximum)

4. PASS 7 — Assembly + Validation
   - Assemble complete draft from Pass 6 forward payload
   - Write <!-- akr-generated --> metadata header (see header format in Step 8)
     Populate fields:
       passes-completed: record actual execution IDs (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 if no split;
                         1,2A,2B,3,4,5,6,7 if Pass 2 was split)
       passes-split: record split type if split occurred (e.g., 2A,2B); empty string if not
       pass-timings-seconds: use pass IDs matching passes-completed
                             (e.g., pass2a=Xs,pass2b=Ys when split; pass2=Xs when not split)
       generation-strategy: section-scoped (or single-pass-fallback if fallback occurred)
     Override annotation examples:
       Backend with pass4 override: passes-completed: 1,2,3,pass4-override,5,6,7
       UI with pass3 override:      passes-completed: 1,2,pass3-override,4,5,6,7
       UI with pass3 override + split: passes-completed: 1,2A,2B,pass3-override,4,5,6,7
   - Run validate_documentation.py against assembled draft
   - Resolve or mark DEFERRED any validation failures
   - Proceed to file write and PR steps
```

### Slow-Generation Handling in Mode B

```text
SLOW GENERATION HANDLING

If total elapsed time across all passes exceeds 45 minutes:
  1. If running in coding agent background mode:
     - Continue and complete the current pass.
     - Proceed automatically to single-pass-fallback (Option B below) for any
       remaining incomplete sections. Do NOT wait for developer input.
     - Set generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback in metadata header.
     - Log ssg-slow-module-event to .akr/logs/session-*.jsonl.
     - Add PR checklist note: "⚠️ Generation exceeded 45-minute threshold.
       Single-pass fallback used for remaining sections. Consider module
       splitting (requires standards team PR) if this recurs."
     - Option A (module splitting) is a POST-PR developer action — the agent
       cannot modify modules.yaml without a standards team PR. The developer
       evaluates module splitting after reviewing this PR.

  2. If running in interactive VS Code mode:
     - Notify developer before proceeding: "Generation is taking longer than
       expected ([X] minutes elapsed). Remaining sections will be completed
       using single-pass fallback unless you choose to stop and split the module.
       A) Stop now — split module in modules.yaml (requires standards team PR)
       B) Continue — use single-pass fallback for remaining sections (more ❓
          markers; Mode C review recommended before merge)"
     - If developer does not respond within the current session, proceed with
       Option B and note the lack of explicit response.

  3. If Pass 2 requires more than 2 splits (>2 sub-passes):
     - Do NOT attempt a third sub-pass.
     - Record passes-completed up to the last completed sub-pass.
     - Proceed to single-pass-fallback for the Operations Map remainder and all
       subsequent sections.
     - Add PR checklist note: "⚠️ Module required >2 Pass 2 sub-passes. Module
       splitting is strongly recommended. See modules.yaml module_group field."

  Option B — Single-pass fallback:
     Load full condensed charter (not section-specific slices)
     Generate remaining incomplete sections in one consolidated pass
     Set generation-strategy: single-pass-fallback in metadata header
     Expect additional ❓ markers — Mode C review is recommended before PR merge
```

### Mode B PR Checklist Additions

- [ ] `<!-- akr-generated -->` header includes `passes-completed` field
- [ ] `pass-timings-seconds` field present (or `unavailable` with justification)
- [ ] If `generation-strategy` is `single-pass-fallback`: Mode C review scheduled
- [ ] If `generation-strategy` is `single-pass`: reviewer is aware output may have more `❓` markers than SSG-generated docs on large modules; use `--use-ssg` for high-complexity modules where pass isolation improves fidelity
- [ ] If `passes-split` is populated: Operations Map reviewed for completeness across sub-passes

## Deliverable 2B: Onboarding Bundle Distribution Workflow

### Objective

Build `.github/workflows/distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` in `core-akr-templates` to distribute one-time onboarding scaffolds to new application repositories via manual dispatch. This workflow is the canonical delivery mechanism for governance artifacts that should be placed once (or refreshed on demand), not re-distributed with every skill release.

### Why Separate From Deliverable 2A

`distribute-skill.yml` (Deliverable 2A) is tag-triggered and designed for recurring artifact updates across all registered repositories. Merging one-time onboarding scaffolds into that workflow creates PR noise in already-onboarded repos and couples unrelated release cadences. The onboarding bundle workflow runs on `workflow_dispatch` only and targets specific repositories selected at dispatch time.

This split model is confirmed per `akr_implementation_ready_analysis.md` section 2.1C (decision date: 2026-04-02). Any future one-time governance scaffold (additional PR templates, CODEOWNERS guidance docs, optional schema seeds, etc.) follows this same pattern: add to the onboarding bundle, not to `distribute-skill.yml`.

### Trigger Conditions

- `workflow_dispatch` only — no tag trigger, no push trigger.
- Input: `target_repo` (required) — the full `owner/repo` name of the repository to onboard.
- Optional input: `dry_run` (boolean, default `false`) — when true, generates a workflow summary of what would be distributed without opening a PR.

### Bundle Contents

| Artifact | Source in `core-akr-templates` | Destination in Application Repo | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR template | `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` | `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` | Governance checklist for documentation PRs |
| CODEOWNERS baseline | `examples/onboarding/CODEOWNERS.baseline` | `.github/CODEOWNERS` (append-mode) | Adds required review paths; does not overwrite existing CODEOWNERS |
| `modules.yaml` seed | `examples/onboarding/modules.yaml.seed` | `modules.yaml` (only if not already present) | Skip if `modules.yaml` exists in target repo |

> **CODEOWNERS note:** The workflow must use append-mode for CODEOWNERS, not a full overwrite. It inserts a clearly delimited AKR governance block so existing team ownership rules are preserved. If `modules.yaml` already exists in the target repo, the seed file is skipped — the step must check for file existence before writing.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create `core-akr-templates/.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` | Standards author | File present in core-akr-templates; content matches pilot copy in training-tracker-backend | 15 min |
| Create `examples/onboarding/CODEOWNERS.baseline` | Standards author | File present; contains AKR governance block with delimiters; covers: `.github/pull_request_template/`, `.github/skills/akr-docs/`, `.akr/` | 30 min |
| Create `examples/onboarding/modules.yaml.seed` | Standards author | File present; minimal valid `modules.yaml` with `modules: []` placeholder and inline comments; passes `validate_documentation.py --all` without content errors | 30 min |
| Author `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` | Standards author | Workflow present in `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/`; syntax valid; `workflow_dispatch` trigger with `target_repo` (required) and `dry_run` (optional, default false) inputs | 2 hours |
| Implement PR template sync step | Standards author | Step clones target repo, copies `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md`, commits, opens PR; PR title: `chore: add AKR documentation PR template` | 45 min |
| Implement CODEOWNERS append step | Standards author | Step reads existing CODEOWNERS (empty if absent), appends AKR governance block within `# BEGIN AKR GOVERNANCE` / `# END AKR GOVERNANCE` delimiters; idempotent (re-run does not duplicate block) | 1 hour |
| Implement `modules.yaml` seed step | Standards author | Step checks if `modules.yaml` exists; skips write if it does; writes seed file if absent; PR body notes file was created as a seed | 30 min |
| Implement dry-run mode | Standards author | When `dry_run: true`, workflow logs which files would be created/modified and exits with no PR opened; summary lists all planned changes | 30 min |
| Add post-sync verification step | Standards author | Workflow summary lists: which files were distributed, PR URL opened, list of CODEOWNERS paths requiring branch protection configuration (as a human-action checklist) | 30 min |
| Test on `training-tracker-backend` | Standards author + infrastructure | Dry-run confirms correct file set; live run opens PR with expected content; CODEOWNERS append does not overwrite existing lines | 1 hour |
| Add `AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` secret note | Infrastructure lead | Confirm same PAT from Deliverable 2A is sufficient (same scope requirements: `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `metadata: read`) | 15 min |
| Document `dry_run` usage in developer reference | Standards author | Developer reference includes example of using dry-run mode to preview onboarding bundle before live dispatch | 20 min |

### Required Secret

`AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` — same fine-grained PAT as Deliverable 2A. No additional scopes required.

            Distributed from `core-akr-templates` via `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml`.

            ### Files distributed
            - `.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` — PR review checklist for AKR documentation PRs
            - `.github/CODEOWNERS` — AKR governance block appended (existing lines preserved)
            - `modules.yaml` — seed file added (only if not previously present)

            ### Required follow-up (human action)
            - [ ] Enable branch protection on default branch
            - [ ] Add required status check: `AKR Documentation Validation`
            - [ ] Confirm CODEOWNERS review is enforced for `.github/pull_request_template/` and `validation/` paths
```

## Deliverable 3: Template Adaptation

### Objective

Adapt `lean_baseline_service_template.md` and `ui_component_template.md` for module-scope documentation; retain database templates as-is.

### Acceptance Criterion

**Critical:** Adapted `lean_baseline_service_template.md` must produce output matching `courses_service_doc.md` structure when used on CourseDomain module (Controller + Service + Repository + DTOs).

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adapt `lean_baseline_service_template.md` | Standards author | Module Files, Operations Map, full-stack diagram sections added | 4 hours |
| Update existing `lean_baseline_service_template.md` front matter block | Standards author | Existing front matter includes both `businessCapability` (PascalCase) and `feature` (work-item ID format) to match Phase 1 validation contract | 30 min |
| Adapt `ui_component_template.md` | Standards author | Module Files, component hierarchy diagram sections added | 3 hours |
| Add module-scope YAML front matter | Standards author | `businessCapability`, `feature`, `layer`, `project_type`, `status` fields documented, with explicit separation between document maturity status and `modules.yaml` grouping approval status | 1 hour |
| **Update all YAML front matter examples to PascalCase** | Standards author | All `businessCapability` examples use PascalCase matching `tag-registry.json` (e.g., `CourseCatalogManagement` not `course-catalogmanagement`) | 1 hour |
| Document direct Mode A manifest review checklist in core-akr-templates | Standards author | Guidance makes `modules.yaml` the only grouping review artifact; checklist covers file-role validation, unassigned rationale review, and human status updates directly in the manifest | 1.5 hours |
| Create `{ModuleName}_draft.md` front matter spec and sample | Standards author | Draft front matter fields defined: preview-generated-at, review-mode (full/incremental), passes-completed, generation-strategy; draft-only fields clearly marked; spec added to DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md; sample CourseDomain_draft.md in core-akr-templates/examples/ | 1 hour |
| Test backend template on CourseDomain | Standards author | Output matches `courses_service_doc.md` structure | 2 hours |
| Test UI template on sample UI module | Standards author | Component grouping logic works; hierarchy clear | 2 hours |
| Document template selection logic | Standards author | `project_type` → template mapping table in README | 1 hour |

**Critical:** YAML front matter `businessCapability` values must use PascalCase (e.g., `CourseCatalogManagement`) to match `tag-registry.json` keys. Otherwise Phase 4's `consolidate.py` will fail to match module docs by feature tag.

### Module Variant Additions (Backend)

**New sections for `lean_baseline_service_template.md` module variant:**

1. **Module Files** (after Service Identification)
   ```markdown
   ## Module Files
   
   | File | Role | Primary Responsibilities |
   |------|------|-------------------------|
   | [file path] | Controller / Service / Repository / DTO | [brief description] |
   ```
   
2. **Operations Map** (consolidates all component operations)
   ```markdown
   ## Operations Map
   
   This section covers ALL operations across ALL files in the module.

## Deliverable 4: `copilot-instructions.md` Rewrite

### Objective

Full document replacement with module-centric template selection logic; remove all MCP server references.

### Why "Full Replacement"

**From analysis:** Direct file inspection confirms ~90% of current content is MCP-server-specific and broken after archive. This is not a text update—it is a conceptual rewrite.

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 hours of focused authoring

### What Must Be REMOVED Entirely

1. **Slash-Commands section** (~52 lines) — every command is an MCP server invocation
2. **Code Analysis Capabilities section** — instructs Copilot to use Tree-sitter AST parsing
3. **Repository Structure Requirements** — references broken paths
4. **YAML front matter example** — uses fields not in `modules.yaml` schema
5. **Template selection logic** — file-centric (structurally wrong)
6. **Support and Troubleshooting section** — references `.vscode/mcp.json`, old script names

### What Must Be RETAINED (3 Elements)

1. **Core Principles section** — transparency markers with updated semantics
2. **Completeness scoring formula** — retain as-is
3. **Vale quality gates reference** — use canonical runtime config path `~/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini`

### What Must Be ADDED (New Content)

1. **Module grouping principles**
   - Domain noun identification
   - Dependency graph following
   - DTO alignment
   - Interface/implementation pairs
   
2. **Template selection table** (from Deliverable 3)
   
3. **`project_type` → condensed charter → template mapping**

4. **Three-mode Agent Skill invocation guidance**
   - When to use Mode A (grouping proposal)
   - When to use Mode B (documentation generation)
   - When to use Mode C (interactive HITL completion for existing drafts with unresolved `❓` markers — replaces `/docs.interview`)
   
5. **`modules.yaml` front matter field reference**

6. **Copilot-specific invocation guidance and model compatibility note**
  - Instruction to always use `/akr-docs mode-a`, `/akr-docs mode-b`, `/akr-docs mode-c` explicitly (never rely on auto-discovery)
  - What to expect at the start of every response: `✅ akr-docs INVOKED AND STEPS EXECUTED` self-reporting block
  - What to do if the self-reporting block is absent: check `/skills` to confirm `akr-docs` is enabled; retry with explicit slash command
  - Note: skill is optimised for Claude Sonnet 4.6; Copilot (GPT-4o) users should expect ~75% first-run pass rate on large modules; CI gate validates output regardless of model

### Target Document Length

**150-200 lines** (vs. current verbose file)

Goal: concise Copilot-native reference that a developer reads once during onboarding

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remove MCP-specific sections | Standards author | 6 sections removed cleanly | 1 hour |
| Author module grouping principles | Standards author | Domain noun, dependency graph, DTO alignment, interface/impl pairs documented | 1 hour |
| Add template selection table | Standards author | All 7 `project_type` values mapped to templates | 30 min |
| Add Agent Skill invocation guidance | Standards author | Mode A, Mode B, and Mode C triggers clear; Mode C noted as `/docs.interview` replacement | 1 hour |
| Add `modules.yaml` front matter reference | Standards author | Required fields per doc type documented | 30 min |
| Validate document length | Standards author | ≤200 lines; concise and scannable | 15 min |
| Test with Copilot in VS Code | Pilot rep | Instructions load correctly; no broken references | 30 min |
| Add Copilot-specific invocation and model compat note | Standards author | Section present covering: (a) always use `/akr-docs` slash command, (b) self-reporting confirmation block, (c) what to do if block is absent, (d) model compatibility note referencing `SKILL-COMPAT.md` for full detail | 45 min |

### Output Location

## Deliverable 5: Schema Deliverables

### Objective

Author new `modules-schema.json`; update `akr-config-schema.json` for `project_type` in required tags.

### `modules-schema.json` (NEW)

**Why needed:** Does not exist in repository; `validate_documentation.py` cannot reference schemas until this exists.

**Critical note:** `modules-schema.json` `project.layer` enum **MUST include `Full-Stack`** for parity with `akr-config-schema.json` `projectInfo.layer`. This is intentionally different from `tag-registry-schema.json` and `consolidation-config-schema.json` which omit `Full-Stack` for governance reasons. The layer enums serve different purposes:
- `modules-schema.json` (project layer taxonomy): includes `Full-Stack`
- `tag-registry-schema.json` (business capability governance): excludes `Full-Stack`
- `consolidation-config-schema.json` (cross-repo aggregation): excludes `Full-Stack`

**Scope:** Define complete `modules.yaml` schema per Part 4 of analysis document.

### Additional Optional Fields for Module Entries

| Field | Type | Validation Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `draft_output` | string (path) | Must be under `docs/` tree; must not duplicate another module's draft_output |
| `last_reviewed_at` | string (ISO 8601) | Parseable as datetime; staleness check deferred to v1.1 |
| `review_mode` | enum: `full` \| `incremental` | Records last Mode B run type; present in draft front matter only, not in final doc |

All four fields are optional. Their absence does not cause validation errors on existing modules.

}
```

### `akr-config-schema.json` Update

**Change:** Add `project_type` and `businessCapability` to `validation.tagValidation.requiredTags`

```json
// BEFORE
"requiredTags": {
  "type": "array",
  "default": ["feature", "domain", "layer"]
}

// AFTER
"requiredTags": {
  "type": "array",
  "default": ["businessCapability", "feature", "domain", "layer", "project_type"],
  "description": "businessCapability and project_type are conditionally required for MODULE-type documents only"
}
```

**Additional Phase 1 schema field (for Phase 3/4 compatibility):**

```json
"script_approval_required": {
  "type": "boolean",
  "default": false,
  "description": "When true, custom-agent script execution must require explicit user approval before running side-effecting script skills"
}
```

This field is introduced in Phase 1 so downstream phases can rely on a stable schema even if
Phase 3 automation is skipped after a successful Phase 2.5 outcome.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author `modules-schema.json` | Standards author | Complete schema per Part 4 specification | 3 hours |
| Update `akr-config-schema.json` | Standards author | `project_type` added to `requiredTags`; conditionality documented | 1 hour |
| Add `script_approval_required` to `akr-config-schema.json` | Standards author | Boolean field present with default `false`; description references custom-agent script gating | 30 min |
| Update `tag-registry-schema.json` layers | Standards author | Decide whether to add `Full-Stack` or document exclusion | 1 hour |
| Validate schemas with test YAML | Standards author | Example `modules.yaml` validates without errors | 1 hour |
| Document schema versioning | Standards author | Schema version tied to `core-akr-templates` release tag | 30 min |
| Add `ssg_pass4_source_reread` optional boolean field to `modules-schema.json` | Standards author | Field present with type `boolean`, default `false`, description: "Authorizes targeted Service file re-read in SSG Pass 4 for modules where service-file comments are the primary business rule source. Requires rationale in notes field." | 30 min |
| Add `ssg_pass3_source_reread` optional boolean field to `modules-schema.json` | Standards author | Field present with type `boolean`, default `false`, description: "Authorizes targeted type file re-read in SSG Pass 3 for UI modules where complex generic types are not representable in the component hierarchy summary." | 30 min |
| Add validator support for both override fields in `validate_documentation.py` | Standards author | Validator reads both fields from modules.yaml; records `pass4-override` or `pass3-override` in validation output when either is `true`; emits INFO log (not warning) noting the override | 1 hour |
| Add both fields to `modules.yaml` example file | Standards author | Fields present with `false` values and inline comment: "# Set true only with documented rationale - see CHARTER-RESTORATION-PLAN.md override guidance" | 20 min |

## Deliverable 6: HITL Alignment

### Objective

Cross-reference `akr-config-schema.json` `humanInput.defaultRole` enum against template "who provides it" columns.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document role mapping | Standards author | Table mapping `defaultRole` values to HITL levels | 2 hours |
| Update template "who provides it" columns | Standards author | Templates use consistent role vocabulary | 2 hours |
| Plan `priorityFilter` integration | Standards author | Design how `validate_documentation.py` v1.1 reads `priorityFilter` to distinguish blocking vs. advisory `❓` | 1 hour |

### Role Mapping Table

| `humanInput.defaultRole` | HITL Level | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `technical_lead` | Level 1 + Level 2 architecture | Grouping validation; architecture diagram review |
| `developer` | Level 2 content | Fills `❓` sections; validates business rules |
| `product_owner` | Phase 4 consolidation | Narrative refinement on feature docs |
| `qa_tester` | Phase 3+ (conditional) | Copilot Studio Teams approval gate |

### Future Integration (v1.1)

```python
# validate_documentation.py v1.1 (DEFERRED)
def check_question_markers(doc, config):
    priority_filter = config.get("humanInput", {}).get("priorityFilter", "important")
    
    if priority_filter == "critical":
        # Only fail on ❓ markers tagged as [CRITICAL]
    elif priority_filter == "important":
        # Fail on all unresolved ❓ markers (current v1.0 behavior)

## Deliverable 2C: Template Directive Architecture & Inline Validator v2

### Objective

Complete the `akr:` directive architecture and prepare the inline validator v2 for distribution. This deliverable implements the finding from CL 42 that templates should be the single source of truth for structural documentation knowledge via machine-readable `akr:` HTML comment blocks.

### Why a Separate Deliverable

The directive architecture (`parse_template_directives.py` + `akr_inline_validate_v2.py` + `test_constants_sync.py`) forms a cohesive subsystem that builds on Deliverables 1 and 2 (validator + CI workflow). Grouping these tasks here keeps the directive-architecture scope explicit and avoids retrofitting Deliverables 1 and 2 retroactively.

**Dependencies:**
- Deliverable 1 (`validate_documentation.py`) must be complete before `akr_inline_validate_v2.py` changes can be tested against the validator contract.
- Deliverable 2A (`distribute-skill.yml`) must be complete before dist-bundle testing includes the updated inline validator.

### Key Design Principle (from analysis Part 20)

Templates carry `akr:section` HTML comment blocks as machine-readable generation contracts. The SKILL.md is a pure executor — it reads structural knowledge from the template at runtime rather than embedding it. This eliminates silent structural drift between the template and the skill.

All required/conditional section IDs, ordering, and condition tokens live in the template. `parse_template_directives.py` is the blocking dependency for directive-aware section validation inside the CI workflow.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Merge `parse_template_directives.py` implementations | Standards author | Single file at `.akr/scripts/parse_template_directives.py`; passes all existing tests; `--all DIR`, `--compact`, duplicate-order validation, and `required`+`condition` contradiction check added from review version; typed field schema and `--output text` retained from current base | 3 hours | High |
| Add duplicate `order` key validation | Standards author (part of merge) | Parser emits a named error when two sections share the same `order` value | (included above) | High |
| Add `required: true` + `condition:` contradiction check | Standards author (part of merge) | Parser emits a named error when a section declares both `required: true` and a non-empty `condition` | (included above) | High |
| Fix compliance mode default in `akr_inline_validate_v2.py` | Standards author | When `--compliance-mode` is not passed, `validate_file()` detects mode from front matter; `"pilot"` is used only when neither CLI flag nor front matter specifies a mode; production-mode docs no longer validate as pilot silently | 1 hour | **Blocking** |
| Apply remaining `akr_inline_validate_v2.py` changes | Standards author | `CONSTANTS_VERSION = "1.0.0"` string present; all four shared enum sets use `frozenset`; `re.DOTALL` comment extraction applied; `_extract_required_sections_from_directives()` returns `None` (not `[]`) when no directive file found; `--constants-version` CLI flag present | 2 hours | High |
| Fix `test_constants_sync.py` path resolution (Bugs 1 and 3) | Standards author | Script reads `os.environ.get("INLINE_VALIDATOR_PATH")` first; falls back to `__file__`-relative path only when env var is absent; env var wiring in `validate-documentation-v2.yml` is consumed correctly | 1 hour | **Blocking** |
| Fix `test_constants_sync.py` hardcoded frozenset comparison (Bug 2) | Standards author | Comparison uses `getattr(full_validator_module, "VALID_COMPLIANCE_MODES", frozenset())` instead of hardcoded literal; test does not break when a third compliance mode is added | 30 min | High |
| Integrate `test_constants_sync.py` into `validate-documentation-v2.yml` | Standards author | "Assert validator constant sync" step runs after checkout and before inline validation; step env includes `INLINE_VALIDATOR_PATH` pointing to the just-fetched inline validator; CI fails if parity check fails | 45 min | High |
| Integrate `parse_template_directives.py` into `validate-documentation-v2.yml` | Standards author | "Build directive-aware required section list" step runs before inline validator execution; output passed as `--required-sections` argument (or equivalent) to inline validator; CI fails if template has no parseable directive blocks | 1 hour | High |
| Clarify `akr-generate.md` Step 2 wording | Standards author | Step 2 text updated to: full template file is fetched via `@github get file`; `parse_template_directives.py` extracts directive blocks from full content; parser output is the required-section list used in generation steps | 30 min | Minor |
| Apply `akr-resolve.md` Phase 4 re-validation path fix | Standards author | Phase 4 re-validation step references correct `validate_documentation.py` path after Phase 1 reorganization; no broken path references | 15 min | Minor |
| Apply `akr-groupings.md` Program.cs 3-criterion threshold table | Standards author | Explicit threshold table added for Program.cs classification rule (3 criteria required to classify as module anchor vs. infrastructure entry point) | 30 min | Minor |
| Test directive pipeline end-to-end | Standards author | `parse_template_directives.py --all templates/` against all templates in `core-akr-templates`; zero errors; CI workflow runs constant sync + directive extraction before inline validation; all existing tests pass | 2 hours | High |

### Known Bugs Addressed by This Deliverable

| Bug Reference | Description | Fix Location |
|---|---|---|
| Gap CL42-1 | `parse_template_directives.py` missing 4 features | Merge task above |
| Gap CL42-2 | `akr_inline_validate_v2.py` compliance mode false-pass | Compliance mode fix task above |
| Gap CL42-3 | `test_constants_sync.py` path hardcoded; env var ignored | Path resolution fix task above |
| Gap CL42-4 | `test_constants_sync.py` hardcoded frozenset comparison | Hardcoded frozenset fix task above |
| Gap CL42-6 | `akr-generate.md` Step 2 wording ambiguous | Step 2 clarification task above |

Note: Gap CL42-5 (Vale working directory regression) is already addressed in Deliverable 2 Change 5. No work item here.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `parse_template_directives.py` passes all existing template parse tests; new features (`--all`, `--compact`, duporder check, contradiction check) verified against lean baseline service template.
- [ ] `akr_inline_validate_v2.py`: production-mode document validates as production when `--compliance-mode production` is passed; also validates as production when front matter declares `compliance_mode: production` and no CLI flag is passed; pilot remains the ultimate fallback only when neither source specifies a mode.
- [ ] `test_constants_sync.py` reads `INLINE_VALIDATOR_PATH` env var when present; parity test passes clean on correct copies; parity test fails with a named error when enum diverges.
- [ ] `validate-documentation-v2.yml` runs constant sync and directive extraction steps before inline validation; CI fails on parity mismatch; CI fails on directive parse failure; Vale step runs from `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` (Change 5 in Deliverable 2).
- [ ] All 7 pending implementation tasks from Part 20.9 of the analysis are resolved or explicitly scoped to a later phase with justification.

## Deliverable 7: Governance Policies

### Objective

Document compliance mode graduation criteria and `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` narrowing.

### Compliance Mode Graduation

**Trigger:** Zero unresolved `❓` markers in production for 4 consecutive weeks

**Process:**
1. Standards team reviews validation logs
2. Confirms no bypass events occurred
3. Tech lead sign-off
4. Update project's `modules.yaml`: `compliance_mode: pilot → production`
5. CHANGELOG entry with date and approver

### `TEMPLATE_MANIFEST.json` Narrowing

**Retain:**
- `templateId → version` mapping
- CI check that Agent Skill references valid `templateId` values

**Deprecate (document in CHANGELOG):**
- Template selection logic (moved to Agent Skill)
- Complexity scoring (replaced by `project_type`)
- File-centric routing (replaced by module-centric)

### Tag Registry Feature Entry Requirements

**Document:** New entries to `tag-registry.json` require:
- `approved`: boolean
- `domain`: string
- `description`: string
- `owner`: string
- `status`: enum {active, deprecated}
- **Optional:** `synonyms`, `relatedFeatures`, `addedDate`

**Validation:** Entries must match `tag-registry-schema.json` `patternProperties` regex (`^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$`)

### Vale Rules Governance

Vale rule files in `core-akr-templates/.akr/vale-rules/` are governed artifacts and the single source of truth. Application repositories must not keep local AKR Vale rule copies.

**To request a rule change:** Open an issue in `core-akr-templates` with the label `vale-rule-request`. The standards team reviews and authors the change in `.akr/vale-rules/`.

**Enforcement model:** CI fetches canonical Vale configuration/rules from `core-akr-templates` at runtime. Distribution workflows do not copy Vale rules into application repos.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |

## Deliverable 7A: Agent Session Hooks

### Objective

Create two hook configuration files that provide local enforcement of the skill execution contract before CI runs. These hooks are distributed to all registered application repositories via `distribute-skill.yml`.

### Why Phase 1

Hooks enforce the in-session contract (Layer 2 of the three-layer reliability stack). Without hooks, the developer has no local feedback if a skill step was skipped - they discover this only when CI fails after PR submission. Hooks close this gap by running `validate_documentation.py` automatically at session end.

### Hook Files

**`.github/hooks/postToolUse.json` - Audit Logger**

Logs every file write during the session to a local JSONL file, providing a session-level audit trail. CI can reference this log to confirm expected output files were written.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "postToolUse": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "mkdir -p .akr/logs; if [ \"$TOOL_NAME\" = \"write_file\" ] || [ \"$TOOL_NAME\" = \"create_file\" ] || [ \"$TOOL_NAME\" = \"run_skill_script\" ]; then echo \"{\\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\\\", \\\"tool\\\": \\\"$TOOL_NAME\\\", \\\"file\\\": \\\"$TOOL_INPUT_FILE_PATH\\\"}\" >> .akr/logs/session-$(date +%Y%m%d).jsonl; fi",
        "timeoutSec": 5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`run_skill_script` is included so Phase 3 code-skill executions are visible in the same session
audit trail as file write operations.

**`.github/hooks/agentStop.json` - Auto-Validation Gate**

Runs `validate_documentation.py` automatically when the agent session ends. Results written to `.akr/logs/last-validation.json`. If validation fails, the developer sees the error immediately in their terminal before opening a PR.

Because local hooks do not run inside GitHub Actions, no `tj-actions` outputs exist at hook time.
The hook must derive a local changed-file list, export it via `CHANGED_FILES`, then invoke `--changed-files` (boolean flag) so the validator can read the env-provided file list.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "agentStop": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "bash": "VALIDATOR=\"$HOME/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py\"; mkdir -p .akr/logs; if [ ! -f \"$VALIDATOR\" ]; then echo '{\"summary\": {\"note\": \"validate_documentation.py not found — initialize ~/.akr/templates via setup-local-cache script or VS Code task\"}}' | tee .akr/logs/last-validation.json; exit 0; fi; if [ ! -f modules.yaml ]; then echo '{\"summary\": {\"note\": \"modules.yaml not found — skipping module-aware validation\"}}' | tee .akr/logs/last-validation.json; exit 0; fi; CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=AM HEAD -- docs); if [ -n \"$CHANGED_FILES\" ]; then CHANGED_FILES=\"$CHANGED_FILES\" python \"$VALIDATOR\" --changed-files --output json --fail-on needs | tee .akr/logs/last-validation.json; else python \"$VALIDATOR\" --all docs/modules --output json --fail-on needs | tee .akr/logs/last-validation.json; fi",
        "timeoutSec": 60
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Scope and Limitations

- Hooks run in Claude Code sessions. Availability in GitHub Copilot depends on Copilot's hook support at the time of Phase 1 execution.
- If hooks are not supported by Copilot at Phase 1 time, document this as a known gap and surface the issue in `SKILL-COMPAT.md`. The CI gate (`agentStop` equivalent) remains the enforcement fallback.
- Local hook `git diff` usage is limited to producing an explicit file list input for `CHANGED_FILES`; validator consumes the list through `--changed-files` + env var semantics.
- Hook files are in `.github/hooks/` to keep them with other GitHub-managed skill files and to allow CODEOWNERS control.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author `postToolUse.json` audit logger hook | Standards author | File present at `.github/hooks/postToolUse.json`; bash command writes valid JSONL to `.akr/logs/session-YYYYMMDD.jsonl`; monitored tools include `write_file`, `create_file`, `run_skill_script` | 1 hour |
| Author `agentStop.json` auto-validation hook | Standards author | File present at `.github/hooks/agentStop.json`; hook resolves validator from `~/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`; derives local changed files into `CHANGED_FILES`; invokes `--changed-files` (fallback `--all docs/modules` when no local changes); writes output to `.akr/logs/last-validation.json`; handles missing validator or `modules.yaml` gracefully | 1 hour |
| Add `.akr/logs/` to `.gitignore` | Standards author | Log files not committed; `session-*.jsonl` pattern in `.gitignore` | 10 min |
| Clarify `.gitignore` scope | Standards author | Root `.akr/logs/` and root-level `.akr/` added to .gitignore (transient session artifacts); `docs/modules/.akr/` is explicitly NOT gitignored - committed working artifacts are intentionally tracked; comment in .gitignore explains the distinction between the two .akr locations | 15 min |
| Test `postToolUse` hook in Claude Code session | Standards author | File write events appear in `.akr/logs/session-YYYYMMDD.jsonl` after Mode B run | 30 min |
| Test `agentStop` hook in Claude Code session | Standards author | Validation output appears in `.akr/logs/last-validation.json`; errors surfaced before PR opened | 30 min |
| Verify hook JSON syntax against Agent Skills spec | Standards author | Both JSON files validate without errors | 15 min |
| Add hooks note to onboarding checklist | Standards author | Onboarding checklist (Phase 2 Deliverable 9) includes step to confirm `.github/hooks/` directory present and both files present | 10 min |
| Document hook unavailability fallback | Standards author | `SKILL-COMPAT.md` includes row noting if hooks are unsupported in Copilot at time of Phase 1; workaround = run `CHANGED_FILES="<space-separated file list>" python ~/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py --changed-files --fail-on needs` manually before opening PR (or `python ~/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py --all docs/modules --fail-on needs` when no file list available) | 30 min |

### Critical Decision: `minimum_standards_version` Initial Value

**Decision required before v1.0.0 release:** Set `minimum_standards_version` in pilot project `modules.yaml`.

**Options:**
- **`v0.0.0` (permissive start):** Allows pilot projects created before v1.0.0 tag to pass validation; provides migration window
- **`v1.0.0` (strict from day one):** Enforces v1.0.0 compliance immediately; any project with `standards_version < v1.0.0` will fail validation

**Recommendation:** `v0.0.0` for pilot projects onboarded during Phase 2. Update to `v1.0.0` after 6-week stability period (before Phase 4). Document this decision in release notes and migration guide.

### Release Notes Structure

```markdown
# core-akr-templates v1.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- Module-based documentation architecture replaces file-centric approach
- Runtime fetch + local cache model replaces submodule/distributed-copy assumptions
- `modules.yaml` now required for module-type-aware validation
- `copilot-instructions.md` fully rewritten; no backward compatibility

## New Features

- **Module-aware validation:** `validate_documentation.py` distinguishes MODULE vs. DB_OBJECT docs
- **Agent Skill three-mode:** Mode A (grouping proposal) + Mode B (documentation generation) + Mode C (interactive HITL completion for existing drafts)
- **Condensed charters:** ~22% of original token count; prevents context saturation
- **Schema-driven validation:** `modules-schema.json` defines complete module manifest contract

## Migration Guide

[Link to migration documentation]

## Known Limitations

- Vale integration is via separate CI step (tight integration deferred to v1.1)
- `--auto-fix` mode deferred to v1.1
- Large modules (>8 files) require manual splitting

## Phase 1 Retrospective

### Retrospective Agenda

1. **Deliverable completion:** Which deliverables exceeded or under-ran time estimates?
2. **Scope creep:** Did any "must-haves" emerge during implementation?
3. **Quality:** Did cross-platform testing uncover unexpected issues?
4. **Team feedback:** Was the 3-5 week estimate realistic?
5. **Phase 2 readiness:** Is v1.0.0 truly pilot-ready?

### Retrospective Outputs

- **Phase 1 completion metrics:** Actual vs. estimated time per deliverable
- **v1.1 backlog:** Features deferred from v1.0 (e.g., `--auto-fix`, tight Vale integration)
- **Phase 2 authorization:** Standards lead sign-off to begin pilot onboarding
- **Lessons learned:** What would we do differently in next major version build?

## Risk Register (Phase 1 Specific)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `validate_documentation.py` scope exceeds 650 lines | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | Ruthlessly defer v1.1 features; focus on critical path |
| Template adaptation breaks existing docs | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 Low | Test on `courses_service_doc.md` acceptance criterion early |
| Cross-platform path issues on Windows | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 Low | Use `pathlib.Path` for all file operations; test early |
| CI workflow JSON compatibility breaks | 🔴 High | 🟠 Low | Verify field names match existing `jq` queries before merge |
| v1.0.0 ships with critical bug | 🔴 High | 🟠 Low | Require ≥85% test coverage; manual testing on all 3 platforms |

---

## Success Criteria Summary

Phase 1 succeeds when:

✅ `validate_documentation.py` v1.0: 500-650 lines; all tests passing; cross-platform validated  
✅ `pyyaml` added to `requirements.txt` as explicit dependency  
✅ CI workflow: 9 changes applied; validates module docs without false positives; `examples/workflows/` copy published
