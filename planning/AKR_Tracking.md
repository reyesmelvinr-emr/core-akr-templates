# AKR Implementation Tracking

Status date: 2026-04-04
Overall status: IN_PROGRESS
Current phase: Phase 2 - Pilot Onboarding

## Governance Rules
- This file is the single source of truth for implementation tracking from Phase 0 through Phase 4.
- Do not create separate summary files during implementation.
- Any issues or clarifications after each phase must be recorded in this file under that phase's Issues and Clarifications section.
- Phase execution order is strict: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2.5 -> 2.6 -> (3 if required) -> 4.
- Phase 2.5 is a binary gate. PASS skips Phase 3. FAIL authorizes Phase 3 only for documented failures.
- Phase 2.6 (Governance Stability Assessment) is mandatory regardless of Phase 2.5 verdict. It runs for one week after Phase 2.5 completes and determines whether any SKILL.md governance steps require migration to code-defined deterministic implementations.
- Phase 4 proceeds unless Phase 2.6 returns "Full Migration Recommended". Targeted migrations run in parallel with Phase 4.

### Issues and Clarifications
- 2026-03-17: Tracking file initialized. No implementation blockers recorded yet.
- 2026-03-17: Implementation kickoff started with charter compression workstream and token validation setup.
- 2026-03-17: Canonical charter sources confirmed under core-akr-templates/.akr/charters. Compressed charter output directory core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions is not present yet and must be created during Phase 0.
- 2026-03-17: Charter compression completed for backend, UI, and DB condensed instruction files. Dual-tokenizer validation recorded: backend 1039/1044 tokens (cl100k/o200k), UI 969/970, DB 846/846.
- 2026-03-17: Created core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md with Mode A, Mode B (SSG passes 1-7), and Mode C plus frontmatter/version and metadata header contract.
- 2026-03-17: Created companion compatibility file core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL-COMPAT.md with model matrix, invocation surfaces, and future enhancement path.
- 2026-03-17: Created modules schema and example manifest: core-akr-templates/.akr/schemas/modules-schema.json and core-akr-templates/examples/modules.trainingtracker.api.yaml.
- 2026-03-17: Initialized eval baseline artifacts in core-akr-templates/evals including benchmark.json and four case skeletons.
- 2026-03-17: Executed baseline test suite in akr-mcp-server (pytest -q): 284 passed, 48 skipped, 24 warnings in 13.44s.
- 2026-03-17: Observed deprecation warning in src/tools/validation_library.py for datetime.utcnow; non-blocking for Phase 0 but should be cleaned in Phase 1.
- 2026-03-17: External dependency identified for Phase 0 cost/legal sign-off; marked blocked pending management and legal artifacts.
- 2026-03-17: Verified required Phase 0 artifacts exist and benchmark.json parses successfully.
- 2026-03-17: Ran AKR documentation validation task across docs and observed broad INVALID results on implementation plan/archive docs due section-rule mismatch (expected pre-Phase 1 validator adaptation scope).
- 2026-03-17: Validation output surfaced multiple broken-link warnings and required-section false positives for non-module doc types; track as Phase 1 validator design input.
- 2026-03-17: New implementation validation path switched to scripts/validation/validate_implementation_non_legacy.py to avoid legacy MCP documentation validation entry points.
- 2026-03-17: Workspace and template tasks were updated so legacy documentation validation tasks are explicitly labeled [LEGACY] and removed from default test group.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 1 documented as FALLBACK due missing CourseDomain/EnrollmentDomain sample modules in current workspace; static analyzer emission path verified.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 2 documented as FALLBACK (hosted MCP config absent), with validated fallback to condensed charters in core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 3 passed via large-module stress case artifact and explicit no-truncation/pass-split assertions in mode-b-large-module.yaml.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 4 documented as FALLBACK because Vale binary/config/rules are not present in local environment.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 6 documented as FALLBACK with Windows+Ubuntu CI evidence; macOS lane pending.
- 2026-03-17: Pre-Pilot Test 7 passed with required skill invocation/mode markers present in SKILL.md.
- 2026-03-18: Legal/security sign-off status updated to COMPLETE; Pre-Pilot Test 5 moved to PASS and pre-pilot checklist now fully resolved.
- 2026-03-18: Prior 2026-03-17 legal/security blocker entry is now resolved; remaining Cost and Governance work is premium request baseline benchmarking only.
- 2026-03-18: Premium request baseline clarified: each developer has a monthly premium quota reset on day 1; Phase 2 and 2.5 metrics will track premium consumption per document for single-pass vs multi-pass and pair it with documentation quality outcomes to define benchmark guidance.
- 2026-03-18: Reviewed implementation plans and validated that the earlier benchmark gap report was partially stale: `core-akr-templates/evals/benchmark.json` is no longer at v1.0 and already includes premium-request, quality, coding-agent, and quota-planning scaffolds.
- 2026-03-18: Residual alignment gaps identified during validation were closed: added `coding-agent.ssg.mode-b-large-module` and `ssg-forward-payload-observation` scaffolds to `benchmark.json`, and updated Phase 0 prerequisites documentation to show the expanded schema-version `1.2` example instead of the earlier minimal `1.1` example.
- 2026-03-18: **GitHub Review — Four Schema Observations Processed (new 143.txt):**
  - **Observation 1 (HIGH PRIORITY — FIXED):** `gpt-4o` model was missing the three top-level eval fields (`mode-a-standard`, `mode-b-coursedomain`, `mode-b-large-module`) that `claude-sonnet-4-6` retains. These fields are required by SKILL-COMPAT.md re-evaluation policy. **ACTION: Added all three top-level fields to `gpt-4o` with null placeholders.** Fixes schema symmetry before Phase 0 gate closes.
  - **Observation 2 (MEDIUM PRIORITY — DOCUMENTED FOR PHASE 2.5 SETUP):** `coding-agent.ssg` block is missing `mode-b-ui-component` entry for Phase 2.5 Test Case 2 (CourseManagementUI). **ACTION: Added `mode-b-ui-component` scaffold under `coding-agent.ssg` mirroring `mode-b-coursedomain` structure with premium-requests and quality sub-blocks.** Deferred to Phase 2.5 data population but now has proper placeholder to avoid runtime errors.
  - **Observation 3 (VALIDATION ONLY):** `mode-b-single-pass` intentionally omits `with-pass2-split` from premium-requests since single-pass by definition does not split. Confirmed as non-issue. No action needed.
  - **Observation 4 (OPTIONAL — COMPLETED):** `quota-planning` block lacked `quota-reset-cadence` field documenting the org-level reset policy. **ACTION: Added `quota-reset-cadence: "monthly-first-day"` to make the block self-contained for readers without external context.** Updated notes to clarify this is an org-wide constant.
- 2026-03-18: Phase 0 gate approved based on complete pre-pilot outcomes (PASS/FALLBACK documented for all 7 tests), legal/security sign-off closure, and validated baseline artifact presence.
- 2026-03-23: **Post-Gate Clarification (Test 2 / Test 2A):** Test 2 (Hosted MCP Context Sources) recorded as FALLBACK at Phase 0 gate time. This status is preserved. A supplemental validation Test 2A (GitHub MCP Server via VS Code — on-demand `@github` tool use) was confirmed PASS on 2026-03-23 and is recorded as an additive test in the Pre-Pilot 7-Test Checklist. The two tests validate different integration surfaces and are both current: Test 2 remains FALLBACK (Hosted MCP Config not present), Test 2A is PASS (GitHub MCP Server authenticated and functional). Phase 0 gate decision is unaffected.

### Issues and Clarifications
- 2026-03-18: Phase 1 execution started immediately after Phase 0 gate approval with tracker-only progress logging rule reaffirmed.
- 2026-03-18: Deliverable 1 (validator v1.0) started first as critical path; initial implementation target path is `core-akr-templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`.
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 1 COMPLETE** — validate_documentation.py v1.0 implemented with 438-line core, module/database doc classification, 9-rule manifest validation, compliance-mode-aware transparency marker checks, --fail-on flag, JSON output contract, and 14 passing unit tests (smoke, module/DB/manifest validation, JSON contract, transparency markers, CLI). Ready for CI integration (Deliverable 2).
- 2026-03-18: Deliverable 2 workflow adaptation applied locally and mirrored to examples workflow. Remaining verification step is an actual GitHub Actions draft-PR run to confirm Checks API annotations and PR comment behavior in-host.
- 2026-03-18: Attempted end-to-end draft PR execution for Deliverable 2 verification. Blocked by environment access constraints: (1) no git remote configured in local `core-akr-templates` clone, (2) GitHub MCP pull-request tools disabled by user policy in this session, and (3) GitHub CLI (`gh`) not installed. Unblock by enabling one path: configure remote + authenticated push/create-PR route, or re-enable MCP PR tools, or install/authenticate `gh`.
- 2026-03-18: GitHub CLI installed and authenticated; draft PR verification executed successfully on `https://github.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates/pull/1`.
- 2026-03-18: Verified run `23233138633` end-to-end behavior: workflow job executed, `Create GitHub Check` step succeeded, `Comment on PR` step succeeded, and check-run annotations were emitted (annotation count: 1 for `docs/ci-workflow-smoke.md` missing `Overview`).
- 2026-03-18: Verification run used a temporary executable copy at `.github/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` in PR branch to exercise GitHub Actions (canonical maintained files remain `.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` and `examples/workflows/validate-documentation.yml`).
- 2026-03-18: Deliverable 2A implementation started: created distribution workflow and bundle artifacts (SKILL + SKILL-COMPAT + hooks) in `core-akr-templates` branch `phase1-deliverable2-ci-verification`.
- 2026-03-18: Attempted to execute `distribute-skill.yml` via `gh workflow run`, but GitHub returned `HTTP 404: workflow ... not found on the default branch`; this is expected until PR #1 is merged or workflow is present on default branch.
- 2026-03-18: PR #1 merged (`43274e8`) so `distribute-skill.yml` is now on default branch.
- 2026-03-18: Executed `workflow_dispatch` for `Distribute AKR Skill` run `23233549396` with target `reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend` (clarification: `TrainingTracker.Api` is a subfolder within this repo, not a standalone repo).
- 2026-03-18: Run evidence captured: `Prepare Distribution Matrix` = SUCCESS; `Distribute to reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend` = FAILURE at `Validate required secret` with log `AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT is not configured`; `Write per-repo summary` executed; `Open follow-up issue on failure` executed but did not create issue because `GH_TOKEN` was empty in-step.
- 2026-03-18: Repository clarification applied: `training-tracker-backend` is the actual repository and `TrainingTracker.Api` is a project/subfolder within it. Updated `.github/registered-repos.yaml` and tracking documentation.
- 2026-03-18: Target PR creation path remains unverified due missing `AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` secret configuration. Re-running workflow dispatch after secret configuration will verify PR creation behavior.
- 2026-03-18: **BLOCKER RESOLVED**: Configured `AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT` repository secret in `core-akr-templates` using authenticated gh CLI token with repo scope.
- 2026-03-18: **DELIVERABLE 2A COMPLETE**: Re-executed workflow_dispatch run `23234217989` with secret configured:
  - **Prepare Distribution Matrix**: SUCCESS (all steps)
  - **Distribute to reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend**: SUCCESS (cloned target repo, synced SKILL bundle files, created PR #1 with body and reviewer checklist)
  - **Distribution Summary**: SUCCESS (final rollup)
  - **Target PR Result**: https://github.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend/pull/1 (MERGED, title: "chore(akr): distribute skill bundle manual-2")
  - **Files Distributed**: SKILL.md (+131 lines), SKILL-COMPAT.md (+33 lines), postToolUse.json (+12 lines), agentStop.json (+12 lines). Hook files included for future local session validation activation.
- 2026-03-18: **INFRASTRUCTURE UNBLOCK SUMMARY**:
  - Blocker 1 (AKR_DISTRIBUTION_PAT): RESOLVED - configured as repository secret
  - Blocker 2 (Target repo identity): RESOLVED - confirmed as reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend
  - All Phase 1 Deliverable 2A verification paths executed and verified successful
- 2026-03-18: **DELIVERABLE 3 COMPLETE**: Template adaptation for module-scope documentation finalized:
  - Created `core-akr-templates/templates/lean_baseline_service_template_module.md` (backend module variant)
  - Created `core-akr-templates/templates/ui_component_template_module.md` (UI module variant)
  - Both templates include new sections for module-scope concerns:
    - Module Files table mapping all files with roles and responsibilities
    - Operations Map showing both API endpoints and internal cross-module contracts
    - Architecture Overview with full-stack text diagram (no Mermaid)
    - Component Hierarchy (for UI template)
    - Hook Dependency Graph (for UI template)
    - Module grouping principle documented (why these files/components belong together)
  - YAML front matter updated to include: `businessCapability` (PascalCase per tag-registry alignment), `feature`, `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, `compliance_mode`
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 3 Acceptance Criterion Met**: Created acceptance test artifact `core-akr-templates/workshops/courses_service_module_doc.md` demonstrating:
  - Adapted `lean_baseline_service_template_module.md` applied to CourseDomain (real module: Controller + Service + Repository + DTOs)
  - All new sections populated with realistic course management content
  - Module Files section lists 5 files (CoursesController, ICourseService, CourseService, ICourseRepository, EfCourseRepository, CourseDtos)
  - Operations Map shows both GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints and internal ValidatePrerequisites contract
  - Architecture Overview displays Controller→Service→Repository→EF→Database full stack
  - PascalCase businessCapability: `CourseCatalogManagement` demonstrates correct format
  - All critical sections present per template structure
  - Form-matches Phase 1 specification for module-variant templates
- 2026-03-18: **Release tag completed with semantic bump**: preserved bootstrap tag `v1.0.0` on commit `3837e6f5c` and created/pushed `v1.1.0` on Phase 1 completion commit `43274e8` to distinguish foundational bootstrap from Phase 1 deliverables.
- 2026-03-18: Release tracking policy confirmed: implementation and release progress continue in `AKR_Tracking.md`; no separate release-notes file generated.
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 4 COMPLETE**: Canonical `copilot-instructions.md` rewritten as a concise module-centric guide with explicit `/akr-docs mode-a/mode-b/mode-c` invocation, self-reporting confirmation expectations, and legacy MCP command removal.
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 5 COMPLETE**: Schema and config contracts aligned for Phase 1 by updating `modules-schema.json`, `akr-config-schema.json`, and module example manifest with SSG override fields and monitoring metrics.
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 6 COMPLETE**: HITL role alignment and `priorityFilter` integration plan documented in `docs/DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md`.
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 7 COMPLETE**: Governance policy docs added for compliance graduation, emergency rollback, template manifest narrowing, and tag registry entry requirements (`VALIDATION_GUIDE.md`, `TAG_REGISTRY_GUIDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`).
- 2026-03-18: **Deliverable 7A COMPLETE**: Hook automation finalized with explicit changed-file passing, local log ignore rules, and documented manual-validation fallback when hooks are unavailable in a given execution surface.
- 2026-03-18: GitHub review follow-up closed for distribution status: target repository PR `reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend#1` is confirmed **MERGED**.
- 2026-03-18: Release verification follow-up closed: `v1.1.0` tag confirmed in `core-akr-templates` locally (`git tag -l v1.1.0`) and on remote (`git ls-remote --tags origin v1.1.0`).
- 2026-03-18: Phase 1 metrics tracking clarification: `Validator false positives` and `Cross-platform pass` are marked DEFERRED and will be closed during Phase 2 pilot measurement runs.
- 2026-03-18: Low-priority technical debt cleanup completed: replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` usage in `src/tools/validation_library.py` with timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`.
- 2026-03-20: **Gap audit identified five missed Phase 1 implementation tasks** (not present in foundation deliverables despite being specified in consolidated plan updates applied 2026-03-19):
  1. **SKILL.md committed workflow steps missing**: Mode A Steps 7.5/7.6 (write committed review sheet, stop for review) and Mode B Steps 5.5/5.6 (write committed draft, surface for preview, resume on approval) not present in SKILL.md. Old sequence still shows write-to-doc_output then open PR at steps 7/8.
  2. **Schema optional fields missing**: `review_sheet`, `draft_output`, `last_reviewed_at`, `review_mode` not added to `modules-schema.json` module items. Schema has `additionalProperties:false` so pilot modules.yaml will fail schema validation if these fields are used before schema is updated.
  3. **Validator --preview flag and cleanliness rules absent**: Both validator copies lack `--preview` argument and the draft-field-in-final-doc ERROR rule. This means final docs won't be caught containing preview/draft-only front matter.
  4. **Review sheet template artifact missing**: No `{project}_review.md` sample/template file exists in `core-akr-templates/templates` or `examples`. Pilot dev has no reference format.
  5. **Draft output template artifact missing**: No `{module}_draft.md` sample/template file exists in `core-akr-templates/templates` or `examples`. Pilot dev has no reference format.
  See deliverable rows above for tracking. Reference plan: PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md.
- 2026-03-20: External review reconciliation (GH 1) completed against current core-akr-templates implementation snapshot. Confirmed additional actionable gaps:
  1. `MODULE_STATUS_ENUM` in validator is missing `review` despite schema allowing it.
  2. Validator does not currently enforce `standards_version >= minimum_standards_version`.
  3. Validation workflow currently hardcodes `--fail-on needs` and does not switch behavior by project compliance_mode.
  4. SKILL metadata example should use dynamic `passes-completed`; Mode A Step 2 wording should be module-scoped.
  5. SKILL-COMPAT.md requires Governance Stability Assessment seed content for Phase 2.6 readiness.
- 2026-03-20: Reopened Phase 1 remediation implementation completed in canonical `core-akr-templates` scope (per approved scope decision), including validator parity, preview/draft checks, schema optional fields, workflow compliance-mode fail behavior, SKILL workflow clarifications, SKILL-COMPAT governance appendix, and committed review/draft templates.
- 2026-03-20: Added validator regression tests at `core-akr-templates/.akr/scripts/tests/test_validate_documentation.py` and executed `python -m pytest .akr/scripts/tests/test_validate_documentation.py -q` in `core-akr-templates` with result `5 passed`.
- 2026-03-20: Canonical workflow parsing defect corrected in `core-akr-templates/.akr/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` (mis-indented `Validate SKILL template references` step) while implementing compliance-mode fail-on derivation.
- 2026-03-20: **Phase 1 gate sign-off evidence**: reopened remediation items verified complete in deliverable table; validator regression suite passed (`5 passed`), and workflow/schema/SKILL reconciliation evidence recorded under Phase 1 deliverables.
- 2026-03-20: External review items marked as already satisfied/superseded (no new task created):
  1. `registered-repos.yaml` exists in core-akr-templates.
  2. `--fail-on` argument exists in validator parser (`errors`, `warnings`, `never`, `needs`, `all`).
  3. Template adaptation deliverable evidence already exists (module templates + workshop example).
  4. Release cadence moved to v1.1.0 operational baseline; legacy v1.0.0-only framing is superseded in current program state.

| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Publish separation-of-concerns ownership matrix in implementation analysis and align references from tracker | Standards author | COMPLETE | docs/akr_implementation_ready_analysis.md updated with Part 3A and ownership model | 2026-03-30 | Establishes single-owner boundary for policy vs workflow vs template shape |
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Publish status-semantics clarification across governance docs before code/schema changes | Standards author | COMPLETE | Updated docs/akr_implementation_ready_analysis.md, docs/implementation_plans/PHASE_0_PREREQUISITES.md, docs/implementation_plans/PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md, core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md, core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md, and core-akr-templates/.akr/schemas/modules-schema.json | 2026-04-02 | Clarifies that `modules.yaml` grouping_status is Mode A approval only, generated document front matter status remains a document-maturity field and defaults to draft on first generation, and removes the `modules-yaml-status` metadata field |
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Update full charters to retain rationale/intent only and remove runtime constraint duplication (D11-A) | Standards author | NOT_STARTED | Pending | TBD | **Acceptance criteria:** (1) `AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` reduced to ≤400 lines (measured at merge); (2) `AKR_CHARTER_UI.md` reduced to ≤400 lines (measured at merge); (3) `AKR_CHARTER_DB.md` reviewed; any equivalent operational prose removed; (4) `Enterprise Best Practices` (lines 469–935) and `Common Anti-Patterns` (lines 1068–1290) relocated to `docs/patterns/backend-best-practices.md` — NOT deleted; (5) `AI-Assisted Documentation Workflow` (lines 939–1016) and `Quick Reference` (lines 1339–1366) removed from charter; (6) `## Purpose` section of each charter updated with one-line handoff note: _"Runtime constraints enforced via copilot-instructions/ and validate_documentation.py."_; (7) Peer review confirms no section removal that belonged exclusively in the charter. See Part 3A Addendum 1 for line-level scope table. |
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Update module templates to keep structure/placeholders only and remove duplicated policy prose (D11-B) | Standards author | COMPLETE | `core-akr-templates/templates/lean_baseline_service_template_module.md`: 7 sections removed — Module Grouping Principle prose (lines 44–52), Capabilities examples (lines 62–68), Not Responsible For examples (lines 75–80), File Interaction Pattern prose, Common Questions bullets, Expected vs Unexpected Failures prose section, and Template Metadata footer. Template reduced from 472 lines (~7,000 tokens) to ~360 lines (~4,200 tokens). | 2026-03-31 | ~2,800 tokens saved per Mode B run. Acceptance: All 7 removals verified complete. Line count now ≤380 lines target met. 
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Refactor condensed and fallback copilot instructions to hold runtime constraints only (D11-C) | Standards author | COMPLETE | `core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions/backend-service.instructions.md`: Section-Scoped Generation Rules section (lines 125–132) replaced with single-line cross-reference to SKILL.md: "SSG pass discipline is governed by SKILL.md §SSG rules. This file does not restate workflow steps." Establishes single source of truth for SSG workflow. | 2026-03-31 | Removes ~150 tokens of duplicated workflow prose. Single-source-of-truth principle applied: policy stays in instructions, workflow orchestration stays in SKILL.md. 
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Refactor SKILL.md steps so workflow remains sequence-only with policy references to copilot instructions (D11-D) | Standards author | COMPLETE | `core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md`: Marker policy block replaced with single-line cross-reference: "Marker policy: Apply rules as defined in the loaded condensed charter (copilot-instructions/). Do not restate marker rules here." Establishes single source of truth for marker semantics. | 2026-03-31 | Removes ~80 tokens of duplicated marker policy. Marker rules now sourced exclusively from backend-service.instructions.md §Transparency Marker Rules prevents drift. 
| Deliverable 11 - Artifact Normalization | Create reusable Section Guidance Block draft and reference it from Phase 2 implementation plan | Standards author | COMPLETE | docs/implementation_plans/SECTION_GUIDANCE_BLOCK_DRAFT.md created; PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md updated with reference and adoption tasks | 2026-03-30 | Supports section-level content guidance (for example TL;DR readability for Product Owner audience) without duplicating global policy |

### Issues and Clarifications
- 2026-03-31: Governance clarification required: `modules.yaml` module status currently records Mode A grouping approval, but generated module docs can be misread as inheriting that status as document approval. Policy intent is that grouping approval authorizes Mode B generation only; it does not approve document content. Governance text across analysis, implementation plans, and condensed instructions must explicitly separate grouping state from document maturity before code/schema remediation proceeds.
- 2026-04-02: Pilot manifest simplification adopted after training-tracker-backend testing. `modules.yaml` is now a lean grouping manifest: module entries contain `name`, `grouping_status`, `doc_output`, and `files` only. `project_type`, `businessCapability`, `feature`, `layer`, `status`, `max_files`, and related descriptive fields are inferred or written during GenerateDocumentation rather than stored in `modules.yaml`.
- 2026-04-02: Decision: remove `modules-yaml-status` (and downstream `modules-yaml-grouping-status` variants) from the `akr-generated` metadata header contract. The field was traceability-only and did not add governance value beyond `modules.yaml` history and current manifest state.
- 2026-04-02: Decision: merged module documents remain `status: draft` by default. PR merge to `main` is operational acceptance, not automatic document-content promotion to `approved`. The option to make `merge = approval` remains deferred for future governance review.
- 2026-03-31: Implemented strategy inversion updates for Mode B documentation generation: single-pass is now documented as the default path and SSG is opt-in via `--use-ssg`. Applied to canonical and template SKILL files plus implementation analysis and Phase 0/1 plan references.
- 2026-03-31: Updated `docs/akr_implementation_ready_analysis.md` rationale to reflect the decision basis for default single-pass (context growth overhead, throughput gains on routine modules, selective SSG use for large/complex modules).
- 2026-03-31: Tracking-file clarification: no `AKR_training.md` file exists in workspace; progress continues in `AKR_Tracking.md` as the existing governance tracker.
- 2026-04-01: Governance decision: retire the Mode A committed review-sheet artifact. Technical lead review will happen directly in `modules.yaml`, which is the authoritative grouping approval object. Mode B committed drafts remain in place because they capture generated document content rather than module-boundary metadata.
- 2026-03-19: Decision made not to proceed with human semantic review on PR #4 using the old PR-diff approach. Mode A workflow superseded by committed review sheet model: agent generates docs/modules/.akr/{project}_review.md, developer reviews in VS Code, agent patches modules.yaml and opens PR only after approval. PR #4 to be closed after new Mode A run produces committed review sheet.
- 2026-03-19: Workflow improvement and governance stability updates incorporated into project plans (consolidated document updates file). Key structural changes: committed review sheet (Mode A), committed draft (Mode B), incremental update workflow, Phase 2.6 Governance Stability Assessment added as mandatory post-Phase 2.5 gate.
- 2026-03-19: New Phase 2 retrospective data collection requirements added to support Phase 2.6: Operations Map completeness rate (GPT-4o), self-reporting block absent rate, friction score, and reassignment churn rate are now required outputs in addition to existing metrics.
- 2026-03-20: Prior Phase 2 blocker (missing Phase 1 SKILL/schema/validator tasks) is now resolved. Mode A and Mode B pilot execution can proceed using direct `modules.yaml` review for grouping approval and committed drafts for documentation preview.
- 2026-03-20: PR #4 confirmed closed by user with superseded comment. Consolidated document updates applied to nine docs confirmed completed by user.
- 2026-03-20: Historical note: Phase 2 was temporarily moved to BLOCKED during external review reconciliation while Phase 1 remediation items were reopened.
- 2026-03-20: Phase 2 status restored to IN_PROGRESS after Phase 1 gate approval and closure of reopened remediation items.
- 2026-03-20: Implementation kickoff executed by expanding Phase 2 deliverable tracking to include task-level rows for Deliverables 1 through 10, including previously missing Deliverable 5 (Visual Studio testing), Deliverable 9 (checklist finalization), and Deliverable 10 (second project onboarding). Progress tracking remains centralized in AKR_Tracking.md only.
- 2026-04-02: Governance controls follow-up completed for pilot readiness:
  1. Created application-repo PR template at `training-tracker-backend/.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md` with structural + content review checklist.
  2. Added module front matter completeness checks to canonical validator at `core-akr-templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`.
     - Enforces required keys: `businessCapability`, `feature`, `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, `compliance_mode`.
     - Validates enum values for `layer`, `project_type`, `status`, and `compliance_mode`.
  This closes requested implementation items 2 and 3 from governance assessment.
- 2026-04-02: Onboarding bundle implementation completed in `core-akr-templates`:
  1. Created canonical onboarding PR-template source directory and file at `core-akr-templates/.github/pull_request_template/documentation.md`.
  2. Created onboarding seed source directory `core-akr-templates/examples/onboarding/` with `CODEOWNERS.baseline` and `modules.yaml.seed`.
  3. Added onboarding distribution workflow `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`, `target_repo`, optional `dry_run`).
  4. Updated implementation plans and analysis docs to explicitly reference onboarding source directories and workflow path.
- 2026-03-20: Deliverable 1 execution started in repository: synchronized onboarding artifacts from templates/core into pilot repo (.github/workflows/validate-documentation.yml, .github/hooks/*.json, .github/skills/akr-docs/*, .vale.ini, validation/vale-rules/*), created root modules.yaml scaffold, and created .github/CODEOWNERS.
- 2026-03-21: Gap audit completed against PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md. Identified 10 task rows defined in the plan that were not yet tracked: 3 in Deliverable 1 (friction doc, tooling validation, Mode A scheduling), 1 in Deliverable 2 (tech lead spot-check), 2 in Deliverable 7 (template iteration and CHANGELOG rationale), and 4 in Deliverable 8 (retrospective deck preparation, recommendations document, template update task, v1.1.0 tag task). All 10 rows added to Deliverable Tracking table. No new files created.
- 2026-03-23: Submodule pin decision: v1.1.0 baseline accepted (Option B).
  Rationale: v1.1.0 is the first complete Phase 1 foundation release. All Phase 1
  remediation items are closed. Running against v1.0.0 (bootstrap commit 3837e6f5c)
  would test an incomplete foundation. Current HEAD f972ce2 includes today's two
  merged PRs (distribution workflow fix + token access investigation) and is
  accepted as the pilot baseline.
  Action taken: Submodule in training-tracker-backend at .akr/templates updated
  from 3837e6f5c (v1.0.0 bootstrap) to f972ce2. Note: submodule path is
  .akr/templates (not templates/core as originally referenced in plan docs).
  Standards version in modules.yaml remains v1.1.0 with
  minimum_standards_version: v1.0.0.
- 2026-03-24: Submodule pin decision resolved. v1.1.0 baseline accepted (Option B).
  Submodule path confirmed as .akr/templates (not templates/core as originally
  referenced in plan docs). Final pin: f972ce2 (v1.1.0-6-gf972ce2), confirmed
  via git submodule status. Standards version in modules.yaml remains v1.1.0
  with minimum_standards_version: v1.0.0.
- 2026-03-20: Validation observations logged as **Phase 2 input only** (non-regressions, no Phase 1 reopen impact):
  1. **OBS-1 (Cosmetic):** `core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL-COMPAT.md` still shows `Last updated: 2026-03-17` after 2026-03-20 edits. Handling: update on next SKILL touch or v1.1.1 tag.
  2. **OBS-2 (Informational):** Governance Stability Assessment seed table column shape differs from `PHASE_2_6_GOVERNANCE_STABILITY.md` formal spec. Handling: add formal per-assessment summary table as a second section when Phase 2.6 begins.
  3. **OBS-3 (Cosmetic/Efficiency):** Validation workflow installs `requests` with `pyyaml` though validator does not require `requests`. Handling: remove `requests` from CI install step in upcoming workflow touch.
  4. **OBS-4 (Minor):** `date -d` usage in Log Usage Metrics is Linux-specific. Handling: defer to D8 cross-platform pass; acceptable while workflow remains on `ubuntu-latest`.
  5. **OBS-5 (Minor):** macOS CI lane from Phase 0 Test 6 fallback remains unresolved. Handling: deferred to Phase 2 pilot cross-platform capture (already reflected by DEFERRED metric).
- 2026-03-20: Vale distribution gap identified. `validation/vale-rules/**` and `validation/.vale.ini` were added to `training-tracker-backend` during onboarding bootstrap (PR #2) but were not yet CODEOWNERS-protected in that repo, and no automated distribution mechanism existed for future rule updates from `core-akr-templates`.
- 2026-03-20: **Decision recorded:** Option A selected (extend `distribute-skill.yml`). Phase 1 plan updated to record the decision and rationale; `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/distribute-skill.yml` updated to distribute `validation/vale-rules/**` and `validation/.vale.ini` alongside skill and hook files. Remaining open item is pilot-repo CODEOWNERS coverage for Vale paths.
- 2026-03-20: Phase 2 Onboarding Deliverable 1 checklist gap identified. CODEOWNERS in `training-tracker-backend` covers `docs/modules/**`, `modules.yaml`, and `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md` but does not cover `validation/vale-rules/` or `validation/.vale.ini`. A follow-up PR to `training-tracker-backend` is required to add these paths before the onboarding checklist can be marked complete.
- 2026-03-23: **GitHub MCP Server (`@github`) confirmed available in VS Code.** On-demand `@github` tool calls return `.akr/charters/AKR_CHARTER_BACKEND.md` and compressed charters from `core-akr-templates/copilot-instructions/`. Extension installed and authenticated. This is a supplemental integration surface — it does not replace the local charter file path used in SKILL.md Mode B Step 2.
- 2026-03-23: **`@github` tool call discipline required for SSG.** Charter must be loaded once in Pass 1 and carried forward as a condensed summary in the forward payload. No re-reads of source files via `@github` after Pass 2. This prevents context re-expansion and quota overuse. SKILL.md Mode B Step 2 to be updated with explicit PATH A / PATH B split and prohibition note.
- 2026-03-23: **Premium request impact of `@github` tool calls.** Each `@github` tool call consumes one premium request in addition to generation calls. Mode B SSG budget is 2 `@github` calls per run (charter + modules.yaml fetches in Pass 1). `benchmark.json` `quota-planning` block to be updated to reflect this.
- 2026-03-23: **SKILL-COMPAT.md gaps identified.** Model Compatibility Matrix does not document `@github` tool failure modes for GPT-4o (known: tool call outputs may be truncated at high pass depths due to model context behavior). Invocation Surface Matrix does not document `@github` MCP surface availability. Both to be updated in Phase 2 change set.
- 2026-03-23: **PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md Deliverable 1 onboarding row needs split.** Current single row "Configure hosted MCP context source OR `.github/copilot-instructions.md`" does not distinguish GitHub MCP Server step. To be replaced with Step 1a (GitHub MCP Server check) and Step 1b (fallback path) in next plan update.
- 2026-03-26: Medium-priority reconciliation applied from repo-state audit:
  1. Updated Deliverable 1 statuses to COMPLETE where evidence already existed but tracking remained stale: fallback copilot instructions, registered-repo entry, and workflow_dispatch distribution verification.
  2. Expanded training-tracker-backend CODEOWNERS coverage to include `docs/modules/**`, `docs/modules/.akr/**`, `.github/hooks/**`, `validation/vale-rules/**`, and `.vale.ini`; closed Vale governance row.
  3. Added non-blocking onboarding task to triage legacy `docs/services/**` artifacts before Deliverable 4 CI scenario runs.
- 2026-03-26: Low-priority housekeeping applied: tracker status date refreshed to current reconciliation date.
- 2026-03-26: Hook validator path defect confirmed in distributed hook files. `agentStop.json` references `.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`, which is not present in application repositories using submodule-based standards delivery.
- 2026-03-26: Architectural decision confirmed: local hooks must resolve validator from `.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` (submodule), not from copied local governance scripts. CI runners remain download-based.
- 2026-03-26: Documentation-spec correction pass applied (no code edits):
  1. `PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md` hook command examples updated to submodule validator path and current validator contract (`CHANGED_FILES` env + boolean `--changed-files`; directory fallback remains `--all docs/modules`).
  2. `PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md` onboarding checklist updated to require submodule initialization and dual log evidence (`session-*.jsonl` and `last-validation.json`) during hook verification.
  3. Runtime hook fix + distribution PR + post-merge Mode B proof remain open and continue under Deliverable 1 hook-validation task.
- 2026-03-26: High-priority implementation pass completed for pilot repo + canonical templates:
  1. **Gap-7 implementation applied:** `agentStop.json` updated to use submodule validator path `.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`, guard missing submodule/modules.yaml, and pass changed files through `CHANGED_FILES` env with boolean `--changed-files`.
  2. **Gap-6 implementation applied:** Added `.akr/logs/` to `training-tracker-backend/.gitignore` to prevent local session artifact commits.
  3. **Gap-4 implementation applied:** Updated `training-tracker-backend/modules.yaml` `project.standards_version` from `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0` to align with accepted baseline notes and avoid standards-version mismatch.
  4. **Gap-13 partial mitigation applied:** `postToolUse.json` now uses portable timestamp/date fallback chain (`python3` -> `date` -> constant fallback). Remaining risk: hook shell runtime availability on Windows local sessions is still open and now explicitly tracked.
- 2026-03-27: SKILL frontmatter compatibility issue observed during pilot Mode A run in `training-tracker-backend` (`prompts-diagnostics-provider` warnings for unsupported attributes `optimized-for`, `tested-on`, `skill-version` in `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md`).
- 2026-03-27: Canonical fix applied in `core-akr-templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md` by migrating model/version fields into supported frontmatter keys: `compatibility.models` and `metadata` (`metadata.skill-version`, `metadata.optimized-for`, `metadata.tested-on`). Follow-up distribution PR to `training-tracker-backend` is required to propagate the fix.
- 2026-03-30: Separation-of-concerns normalization plan added as Phase 2 Deliverable 11 to reduce overlap across charter/template/copilot-instructions/SKILL artifacts and optimize context window consumption. Scope includes coordinated updates, validator/pilot verification, and distribution evidence capture.
- 2026-03-30: Added reusable section-level guidance artifact `docs/implementation_plans/SECTION_GUIDANCE_BLOCK_DRAFT.md` and linked it in Phase 2 Mode B plan so pilot runs can validate TL;DR readability expectations for Product Owner and QA audiences before template-wide standardization.
- 2026-03-30: ICS-D11: Three housekeeping items identified during Part 3A separation-of-concerns assessment; recorded as non-blocking inputs for D11 execution:
  1. **ICS-D11-A (Low — Marker rendering):** `.akr/standards/copilot-instructions.md` emoji markers (🤖 and ❓) may be rendering as garbled characters in some editing environments. This file is the canonical standard description used as human reference for marker semantics. Required action before D11-F distribution: open file, verify emoji markers render correctly, restore correct characters if garbled. Owner: Standards author. Estimated time: 15 minutes.
  2. **ICS-D11-B (Medium — SKILL.md marker duplication):** `SKILL.md` body contains a standalone marker policy block (approximately lines 117–121 in current distributed version) that duplicates the identical rules in `backend-service.instructions.md §Transparency Marker Rules`. After D11-D SKILL.md refactor, this block must be replaced with a single cross-reference: "Apply marker rules as defined in the loaded condensed charter (copilot-instructions/)." This removes the dual-source-of-truth risk before both files can diverge independently. Owner: Standards author. Work folded into D11-D.
  3. **ICS-D11-C (Medium — SSG pass discipline duplication):** `backend-service.instructions.md §Section-Scoped Generation Rules` (approximately lines 125–132 in current version) restates SSG pass-discipline workflow steps that are already governed by `SKILL.md §SSG rules`. After D11-C instructions refactor, this section must be replaced with a one-line cross-reference: "SSG pass discipline is governed by SKILL.md §SSG rules. This file does not restate workflow steps." Owner: Standards author. Work folded into D11-C.
- 2026-03-31: **ARTIFACT NORMALIZATION D11-B/C/D COMPLETE**: Three major reductions to context bloat executed and verified:
  1. **D11-B (Template normalization)** completed: `lean_baseline_service_template_module.md` reduced from 472 lines (~7,000 tokens) to ~360 lines (~4,200 tokens) by removing 7 sections of policy prose and examples. Net savings: ~2,800 tokens per Mode B run.
  2. **D11-C (Instructions consolidation)** completed: Section-Scoped Generation Rules section in `backend-service.instructions.md` replaced with single-line cross-reference to SKILL.md. Removes ~150 tokens of duplicated workflow prose.
  3. **D11-D (SKILL.md refactor)** completed: Marker policy block in `SKILL.md` replaced with single-line cross-reference to instructions file. Removes ~80 tokens of duplicated marker policy. Single source of truth now established for every major policy rule.
  4. **Blocking dependency satisfied**: Per REC-TRACKING-4, D11-B and D11-F blocking prerequisites for Mode B pilot runs are now unblocked after D11-B COMPLETE. Proceeding with D11-F (distribution) to sync normalized artifacts to training-tracker-backend pilot repo.
- 2026-03-31: **GH24/GH25 QUALITY PASS COMPLETE**: All 19 GH25 recommendations implemented across 3 files (SKILL.md, template, instructions). Changes are in priority order per GH25 sequencing constraints. Workshop sample (REC-W1) deferred as P3 until skill+template stabilize through pilot.
  - **SKILL.md (7 changes)**: Fixed template filename alias to canonical path (REC-S1 P0-blocking); added Source Grounding section with fabrication prohibition and confirmed-vs-inferred discipline (REC-S2, REC-S6); added Conditional Sections block (API Contract, Validation Rules, Consumer Map, Related Documentation conditionality) (REC-S7); expanded Pass 7 with template conformance check (REC-S3); added Source Grounding unknown-minimization rule (REC-S5); added readability floor to Output quality requirements (REC-S4).
  - **Template (8 changes)**: Removed Module Files Detailed Breakdown (REC-T5); merged Dependencies + Consumers into Architecture Overview, removed standalone Architecture section (REC-T1); marked API Contract conditional (REC-T6); marked Validation Rules conditional (REC-T7); removed Maintenance Checklist (REC-T3); marked Related Documentation conditional with comment (REC-T4); removed Change History (REC-T2); narrowed Quick Reference and Business Rules human placeholder prompts (REC-T8).
  - **Instructions (4 changes in same pass for REC-S6 coordination)**: Updated Transparency Marker Rules to reflect confirmed-vs-inferred discipline (REC-S6 coordination); added Grounding Rules subsection (REC-I1); added Readability Floor subsection (REC-I2); added Unknowns Discipline subsection (REC-I3).
- 2026-03-31: **GH26 FOLLOW-UP PASS COMPLETE**: 8 remaining issues resolved across 3 files (SKILL-R1–R3, TMPL-R1–R3, INST-R1–R2). SKILL-R4 closed as no-op (ui-component.instructions.md verified present). Workshop sample excluded per plan (not a reference artifact).
  - **SKILL.md (3 changes)**: Swapped steps 8/9 so metadata header check precedes PR open (SKILL-R1); resolved marker policy self-contradiction — Source Grounding now explicitly supersedes charter for grounding-specific ❓/🤖/unmarked decisions (SKILL-R2); added `excluded-sections` front matter instruction so Pass 7 can distinguish conformant omissions from errors (SKILL-R3).
  - **Template (3 changes)**: Renamed `## What & Why` → `## Purpose and Scope`; removed `### Capabilities` (duplicated Operations Map) (TMPL-R1); moved conditional comments above headings for Dependencies and Consumers so agents omit the heading along with the table (TMPL-R2); replaced free-form Request Example generation prompt with source-constrained version prohibiting invented domain values (TMPL-R3).
  - **Instructions (2 changes)**: Removed duplicate ❓ rule from Transparency Marker Rules; added forward reference to Unknowns Discipline; clarified NEEDS construct — do not combine ❓ and NEEDS as compound marker (INST-R1); bumped version from 1.0 → 1.1 and added Change Log section (INST-R2 — subsequently reverted by GH27, see below).
- 2026-03-31: **GH27 CORRECTION APPLIED**: INST-R2 (version bump + Change Log) withdrawn and reverted. Reasoning validated: Change Log in a context-window instruction file violates the file's own Exclusions rule ("Change History — Git is the source of truth") and wastes context budget with zero generation value. Version header bump deferred until `SKILL-COMPAT.md` has a charter version tracking table with an actual consumer. `backend-service.instructions.md` restored to `Version: 1.0`; Change Log section removed. Compensating action: added `## Charter Version Compatibility` table to `SKILL-COMPAT.md` — the correct artifact for recording charter-to-skill version correspondence, read by humans not agents.
- 2026-04-04: **Hook primary path confirmed: `$HOME/.akr/templates/` (local-cache, runtime-fetch).** Decision made in this session after reviewing the CL 41 Critical Assessment recommendation and the architecture divergence documented in the 2026-04-04 tracker update. The `.akr/templates/` git submodule in `training-tracker-backend` is being retired. CI runner path (`git clone ... ~/.akr/templates` in workflow) is unchanged. All per-developer hook execution will use `$HOME/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`. D12 hook path decision row marked COMPLETE.
- 2026-04-04: **Cascade impact analysis for submodule removal completed.** Six concrete impacts identified from the hook path confirmation and submodule retirement decision:
  1. `review/SKILL.md` — PATH B routing still references `.akr/templates/.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/` (submodule path); Failure Handling step 2 still mentions submodule initialization. Both must be corrected before D12 promotion. Tracked as D12 pre-promotion fix row.
  2. `review/validate-documentation.yml` — Vale `cd` working-directory bug: workflow does `cd ~/.akr/templates` before invoking Vale with workspace-relative `$DOC_FILES` paths, causing silent validation failure. Fix: run `vale --config ~/.akr/templates/.akr/.vale.ini $DOC_FILES` from workspace root. Tracked as D12 pre-promotion fix row. HIGH priority.
  3. `training-tracker-backend/.github/hooks/agentStop.json` — Two required changes: (a) `VALIDATOR` path from `.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` → `$HOME/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py`; (b) error message from "run git submodule update ..." → "run git clone https://github.com/reyesmelvinr-emr/core-akr-templates ~/.akr/templates". Tracked under D1 companion hook-update row (ARCHITECTURE UPDATE).
  4. `training-tracker-backend/.github/workflows/validate-documentation.yml` — Dead submodule fallback at lines 113–114 (`.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/...`). Resolves automatically when D12 promoted `review/validate-documentation.yml` replaces it; no separate fix needed if D12 proceeds promptly.
  5. `training-tracker-backend/.gitmodules` + `.akr/templates/` directory — Submodule still registered. Requires dedicated git operations: `git submodule deinit -f .akr/templates`; `git rm .akr/templates`; `rm -rf .git/modules/.akr/templates`; empty or remove `.gitmodules`. Cannot be done with file edits alone; requires a dedicated PR.
  6. Setup-local-cache is now **mandatory** for every developer, not optional. Onboarding checklist must treat this step as a blocking prerequisite before hook validation. Setup delivery vehicle: extend `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` to deliver a setup script/VS Code task into target repos (covers project-level setup); per-developer README/SETUP.md documentation is also required since the workflow cannot execute on individual workstations.
- 2026-04-04: **`distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` extension scope identified for setup-local-cache delivery.** The workflow currently distributes three artifacts (PR template, CODEOWNERS block, `modules.yaml` seed). It can be extended to also deliver a `.vscode/tasks.json` "AKR: Setup Local Cache" task and/or a `scripts/setup-akr-cache.sh` / `setup-akr-cache.ps1` setup script. The workflow runs once at project level and opens a PR — it cannot execute on individual developer workstations. Two-pronged delivery is required: (1) workflow delivers setup artifact into repo, (2) per-developer documentation in `DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md` or new `SETUP.md` explains the mandatory one-time setup step. Both tracked under D12 setup-local-cache documentation row.

### Gate Decision
- Phase 2 Gate: PENDING
- D11-B dependency: RESOLVED (2026-03-31). Template normalization complete; `lean_baseline_service_template_module.md` reduced to ~360 lines (~4,200 tokens). Mode B pilot runs may proceed.
- D11-F distribution dependency: BLOCKING for Deliverable 3 Mode B runs unless each pre-distribution run is flagged [PRE-DISTRIBUTION — EXCLUDE FROM BENCHMARK]. D11-F requires D12 canonical promotion of `review/` artifacts to be complete first before `distribute-skill.yml` can be executed. D12 sequencing: (1) ~~decide hook primary path~~ **RESOLVED 2026-04-04** — `$HOME/.akr/templates/` confirmed, (2) complete pre-promotion fixes (SKILL.md PATH B + Failure Handling; Vale `cd` bug), (3) promote review/ → canonical, (4) execute distribute-skill workflow, (5) open PR in training-tracker-backend, (6) mark D11-F COMPLETE.
- D11-A charter reduction dependency: NOT blocking for Mode B pilot start; MUST be complete before Phase 2 retrospective sign-off. (Status unchanged.)

## Phase 2.6 - Governance Stability Assessment
Status: NOT_STARTED
Start date: TBD (begins after Phase 2.5 completes)
End date: TBD

### Purpose
Determines whether SKILL.md governance fidelity is acceptable for production use, or whether specific deterministic steps (Operations Map extraction, draft writing, validation) should migrate to code-defined `@skill.script` implementations. Independent of Phase 2.5 verdict.

### Deliverable Tracking
| Deliverable | Task | Owner | Status | Evidence | Completion Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data Collection | Receive five Phase 2.5 handoff data items; run Operations Map completeness measurement | Standards author | NOT_STARTED | Pending | TBD | Script: evals/scripts/check_ops_map_completeness.py |
| Assessment | Evaluate four governance stability criteria; produce verdict | Standards lead | NOT_STARTED | Pending | TBD | |
| SKILL-COMPAT.md Update | Record verdict in Governance Stability Assessment Record; distribute via distribute-skill.yml | Standards author | NOT_STARTED | Pending | TBD | |

### Assessment Criteria
| Criterion | Target (Acceptable) | Requires Targeted Migration |
|---|---|---|
| First-run CI pass rate | >= 95% | < 90% |
| Operations Map completeness on GPT-4o | >= 90% of methods (public + private + async) | Private/async methods consistently missing |
| Self-reporting block absent rate | < 5% of Mode B runs | >= 10% of runs |
| Post-model-update regression potential | Baseline gap <= 10 points | Gap > 10 points AND growing |

### Verdict Options
- `SKILL.md Governance Acceptable`: All criteria met - no migration authorized
- `Targeted Migration Authorized`: One or more criteria failed - specific steps migrate to `@skill.script`; runs in parallel with Phase 4
- `Full Migration Recommended`: Three or more criteria failed - Phase 4 blocked until scope documented and management signs off

### Issues and Clarifications
- No entries yet.

### Gate Decision
- Phase 2.6 Gate: PENDING
- Phase 4 proceeds unless verdict is "Full Migration Recommended". Targeted migrations do not block Phase 4.

Five missed Phase 1 implementation tasks identified and added as deliverable rows under Phase 1 and tracking notes under Phase 2: (1) SKILL.md committed workflow steps, (2) schema optional fields, (3) validator preview/draft checks, (4) review sheet template, (5) draft output template. Phase 2 execution remains blocked until these are resolved. Reference plan file for all five items: PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md.
- 2026-03-20: Added OBS-1 through OBS-5 as Phase 2 input observations (non-regressions) under Phase 2 Issues and Clarifications; no Phase 1 reopen triggered.
- 2026-03-20: Expanded Phase 2 deliverable table to task-level execution tracking from PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING and added missing deliverables (Visual Studio testing, checklist finalization, second-project onboarding) without creating separate progress files.
- 2026-03-20: Started Phase 2 implementation work by applying Deliverable 1 onboarding artifacts directly in akr-mcp-server and updating corresponding Phase 2 row statuses/evidence in this tracker.
- 2026-03-23: Recorded GitHub MCP Server (`@github`) confirmation (Test 2A) as supplemental to Phase 0 Pre-Pilot Checklist. Added Phase 0 post-gate clarification note. Added Phase 2 operational impact entries for `@github` tool call discipline, premium request counting, SKILL-COMPAT.md gaps, and onboarding row split. Added three Phase 2 Deliverable 1 task rows for Step 1a/1b/1c GitHub MCP Server handling.
- 2026-03-23: Applied `@github` tool call discipline updates to SKILL.md (Mode B Step 2 PATH A/PATH B split), SKILL-COMPAT.md (gpt-4o failure modes + surface availability table), benchmark.json (github-mcp-calls-per-run and quota-planning fields), and PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md (Deliverable 1 row split + Deliverable 5 scope update). All changes authorized as Phase 2 change request per consolidated assessment in docs/CL1.txt (2026-03-23).
- 2026-03-30: Added Phase 2 Deliverable 11 (Artifact Normalization) to track coordinated separation-of-concerns updates across charters, templates, copilot instructions, and SKILL workflow steps, plus validation and distribution verification.
- 2026-04-01: Updated Mode A governance direction after technical review: removed the extra review-sheet step from active workflow, switched pilot execution and metrics to direct `modules.yaml` review, and aligned analysis plus implementation plans to the manifest-as-source-of-truth model.
- 2026-04-04: Created `planning/implementation_plans/` directory with all eight phase plan documents (PHASE_0 through PHASE_4 including PHASE_2_5/2_6 and IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_OVERVIEW). Companion artifacts `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `planning/Code Defined Skills.md` also created.
- 2026-04-04: Applied wording consistency passes (Round 1 and Round 2) across all eight phase plan files. No policy changes; editorial/terminology normalization only.
- 2026-04-04: Created `review/` directory with seven optimized v1.1.0 skill architecture artifacts: thin-dispatcher SKILL.md, three mode scripts (akr-groupings, akr-generate, akr-resolve), revised distribute-skill.yml, revised validate-documentation.yml, and MIGRATION_GUIDE.md. Pending canonical promotion under D12.
- 2026-04-04: Added Phase 2 D11 rows to track the above creation work. Added D12 deliverable block (v1.1.0 Skill Architecture Promotion) capturing all promotion, distribution, and release tasks as Next Steps for v1.1.0 Release. Added companion hook-update row under D1 for architecture divergence without overwriting existing in-progress rows. Added Issues and Clarifications entries for hook architecture divergence decision required before D12 proceeds.
- 2026-04-04: **Implementation plan documents created.** `planning/implementation_plans/` directory scaffolded with eight phase plan files: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_OVERVIEW.md`, `PHASE_0_PREREQUISITES.md`, `PHASE_1_FOUNDATION.md`, `PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md`, `PHASE_2_5_CODING_AGENT_SPIKE.md`, `PHASE_2_6_GOVERNANCE_STABILITY.md`, `PHASE_3_AUTOMATION_EXTENSION.md`, `PHASE_4_FEATURE_CONSOLIDATION.md`. Companion planning artifacts `planning/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `planning/Code Defined Skills.md` also created. These documents are reference artifacts for the implementation program; `AKR_Tracking.md` remains the single source of truth for status and decisions.
- 2026-04-04: **`review/` optimization artifacts created.** New optimized skill architecture authored and placed in `core-akr-templates/review/` for review before canonical promotion: `SKILL.md` (thin dispatcher, ~400 tokens, v1.1.0), `akr-groupings.md`, `akr-generate.md`, `akr-resolve.md` (mode scripts loaded on demand via `@github`), `distribute-skill.yml` (no distributed Vale copies — runtime-fetch model), `validate-documentation.yml`, and `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`. Thin dispatcher reduces per-invocation context load from ~3,500 tokens to ~400 tokens; mode scripts add ~600–800 tokens per targeted operation. Artifacts are pending review and canonical promotion (see D12 tasks).
- 2026-04-04: **Hook architecture divergence documented.** The 2026-03-26 tracker entry records the architectural decision that local hooks resolve the validator from `.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` (git submodule in the application repo). The Phase 1 implementation plan documents (updated in the previous session) now specify `$HOME/.akr/templates/.akr/scripts/validate_documentation.py` (user-home local-cache model, consistent with runtime-fetch architecture). The `review/SKILL.md` Failure Handling section explicitly supports BOTH paths via a fallback chain (submodule first, then home cache). **Decision required before D12 hook update task:**  (a) continue using `.akr/templates/` submodule in `agentStop.json` as primary path and treat `~/.akr/templates/` as fallback only, OR (b) shift primary to `~/.akr/templates/` and retire submodule dependency in application repos. The original submodule-path hook rows are preserved without modification; the companion task row (ARCHITECTURE UPDATE) tracks the new-model update path.
- 2026-04-04: **Wording consistency passes completed** across all eight phase plan files. Round 1 fixed stale `.akr/ → validation/` migration language and updated hook VALIDATOR path examples in Phase 0, 1, and 2 plan documents. Round 2 normalized KNOWN-GAP, HARD-GATE, and ASYNC-REVIEW-GATE token capitalization; ≥/≤ threshold symbols (replacing `>=`/`<=`); em dashes in narrative and table cells; and "businessCapability tagging" terminology in Phase 4. All changes are editorial/wording only — no policy content was altered. Verification greps returned zero residual stale phrases.
- 2026-04-04: **Hook primary path decision recorded.** `$HOME/.akr/templates/` (local-cache, runtime-fetch) confirmed as the primary validator resolution path for per-developer `agentStop.json` hook execution. Git submodule at `.akr/templates/` in `training-tracker-backend` is being retired. D12 hook path decision row marked COMPLETE. Six cascade impacts identified and added to Issues and Clarifications (see 2026-04-04 cascade entry). Two D12 pre-promotion fix rows added (SKILL.md PATH B + Failure Handling; Vale `cd` bug) as blocking prerequisites before any `review/` artifact is promoted to canonical path. D12 setup-local-cache row updated to note setup-local-cache is now mandatory (not optional) and that `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` extension is the delivery strategy for per-project setup artifact delivery. Phase 2 Gate Decision sequencing note updated to reflect D12 hook path resolution. PHASE_2_PILOT_ONBOARDING.md updated with submodule removal task, setup-local-cache mandatory note, and `distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` extension scope note.
- 2026-04-04: **Recent implementation sync completed (core + pilot repos).**
  1. D12 pre-promotion blockers resolved: updated `review/SKILL.md` PATH B + Failure Handling to local-cache model and fixed Vale workspace-root execution in `review/validate-documentation.yml`.
  2. Canonical promotions completed for: `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md`, `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-groupings.md`, `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-generate.md`, `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/akr-resolve.md`, `.github/workflows/validate-documentation.yml`, and `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`.
  3. Pilot repo architecture updates applied: `training-tracker-backend/.github/hooks/agentStop.json` switched to `$HOME/.akr/templates/...`; `training-tracker-backend/README.md` updated with mandatory local-cache setup; legacy `.akr/templates` submodule removed (`.gitmodules` removed and submodule entry deleted).
  4. Distribution workflow re-run succeeded after promotions: `core-akr-templates` Actions run `23956064464` completed all jobs successfully for target `reyesmelvinr-emr/training-tracker-backend`.
