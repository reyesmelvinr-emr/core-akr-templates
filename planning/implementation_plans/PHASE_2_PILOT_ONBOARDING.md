# Phase 2: Pilot Project Onboarding — Implementation Plan

**Duration:** 1-2 weeks per project  
**Team:** Standards team (0.5 FTE) + pilot project team (1-2 developers)  
**Prerequisite:** Phase 1 complete; `core-akr-templates` v1.0.0 tagged  
**Target:** One complete end-to-end pilot with retrospective

---

## Overview

Phase 2 validates the entire documentation workflow on a real project from grouping proposal through CI validation. The pilot proves that module-based documentation is faster than manual documentation, that validation catches errors before merge, and that the governance model works at team scale.

**Critical Path:** Project onboarding → Mode A grouping → Mode B generation → PR validation → Retrospective

---

## Acceptance Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when:

1. ✅ Pilot project selected and onboarded (recommended: TrainingTracker.Api)
2. ✅ Mode A (grouping proposal) completed; `modules.yaml` grouping approval completed in ≤15 minutes
3. ✅ Mode B (documentation generation) completed for 3 modules, with document review performed separately from grouping approval
4. ✅ First documented PR opened; CI validation passes
5. ✅ Workflow tested in Visual Studio (or documented fallback if skills unavailable)
6. ✅ Two additional modules documented independently (unassisted)
7. ✅ 2-4 week pilot period completed
8. ✅ Pilot retrospective conducted with quantitative metrics
9. ✅ Templates and validator updated based on findings (if needed)
10. ✅ Onboarding checklist finalized
11. ✅ Second project onboarded using updated checklist

**Exit Gate:** Pilot retrospective complete; lessons learned documented; Phase 2.5 authorized if metrics support expanded rollout.

---

## Pilot Project Selection Criteria

### Recommended: TrainingTracker.Api

**Why ideal:**
- Pure API layer (clear `project.layer: API`)
- 3-5 well-defined domain modules (Courses, Enrollments, Users)
- Standard Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- Database objects clearly separable
- Team familiar with codebase (fast grouping validation)
- Active development (real PRs to test validation)

### Alternative Considerations

| Project | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend UI project | Tests `ui-component` workflow | May have fewer clear module boundaries |
| Microservice | Tests lightweight service pattern | May be too simple to stress-test |
| Full-stack monolith | Tests both UI and API simultaneously | Complexity may obscure pilot signal |

### Selection Decision

**Owner:** Standards lead + management  
**Deadline:** Before Phase 2 begins  
**Deliverable:** Pilot project identified; team assigned; kickoff scheduled

---

## Deliverable 1: Per-Project Onboarding

### Objective

Onboard pilot project with all Phase 1 deliverables; configure tooling end-to-end.

### Onboarding Checklist

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Remove `.akr/templates` git submodule (migration only — pilot repos onboarded under old model) | Pilot dev | `git submodule deinit -f .akr/templates`; `git rm .akr/templates`; `rm -rf .git/modules/.akr/templates`; `.gitmodules` emptied or removed; `git submodule status` returns empty; dedicated migration PR merged before hook validation proceeds | 30 min |
| Step 1a: Confirm GitHub MCP Server (`@github`) available in VS Code | Pilot dev | GitHub MCP extension installed and authenticated; `@github get files with names like CHARTER.md` returns charter files | 10 min |
| Step 1b: Configure hosted MCP context source OR `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as primary charter delivery fallback | Pilot dev | Context source configured; condensed backend charter accessible | 30 min |
| Confirm initial skill and mode-scripts distribution | Pilot dev | `distribute-skill.yml` workflow has run for this repo; `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md`, all three mode scripts (`akr-groupings.md`, `akr-generate.md`, `akr-resolve.md`), `akr_inline_validate.py`, and `validate_documentation.py` are present under `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/`; `SKILL_VERSION` matches current release | 10 min |
| Deploy `validate-documentation.yml` | Pilot dev | Workflow file in `.github/workflows/`; triggered on draft PR | 30 min |
| Create initial `modules.yaml` | Pilot dev | Project section complete; `modules[]` empty; `database_objects[]` empty | 30 min |
| Run onboarding bundle distribution workflow (recommended) | Pilot dev + standards author | `core-akr-templates/.github/workflows/distribute-onboarding-bundle.yml` executed for target repo; source directories confirmed: `.github/pull_request_template/` and `examples/onboarding/`; PR template + seed assets arrive via PR | 20 min |
| Test CI workflow | Pilot dev | Trigger workflow on draft PR; verify it runs without errors | 30 min |
| Create CODEOWNERS file | Pilot dev | Standards team + tech lead as owners for `docs/**`, `modules.yaml`, and `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md` | 20 min |
| Register repo in `core-akr-templates` | Standards author | Entry added to `registered-repos.yaml`; registration PR merged | 15 min |
| Verify distribution workflow reaches this repo | Pilot dev | `workflow_dispatch` targeting this repo opens an update PR | 15 min |
| Confirm `.github/hooks/` directory present | Pilot dev | Both `postToolUse.json` and `agentStop.json` present in application repo (distributed by `distribute-skill.yml`); run a Mode B session and confirm both `.akr/logs/session-YYYYMMDD.jsonl` and `.akr/logs/last-validation.json` are created | 15 min |

Recommended CODEOWNERS additions:
- `docs/modules/**  @org/standards-team @tech-lead`
- `modules.yaml     @org/standards-team`
- `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md  @org/standards-team`
- `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/**  @org/standards-team`

**Critical:** Do not use a git submodule for `core-akr-templates` in application repositories. The CI workflow clones `core-akr-templates` to `~/.akr/templates/` on GitHub Actions runners at runtime. Developer workstations do not need a local clone. If a repo was onboarded under the old submodule model, the submodule must be removed via git operations (see migration row above) before hook validation — file deletion alone is not sufficient.

**Note on hook validation (2026-04-05):** `agentStop.json` now resolves `validate_documentation.py` from `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/` (the distributed workspace copy), not from `~/.akr/templates/`. Hook validation requires `distribute-skill.yml` to have run for this repo at least once. Until `validate_documentation.py` is present in the workspace, the hook exits gracefully with an advisory message and does not block the session.

**Note on skill maintenance:** After onboarding, developers should never manually edit `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md` in application repositories. All updates originate in `core-akr-templates` and are delivered automatically via pull request.

**Critical:** `modules.yaml` must be in CODEOWNERS to prevent rogue changes to module boundaries, grouping approvals, or output paths without standards team review.

**Critical:** `.github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md` must be in CODEOWNERS so manual edits cannot bypass standards-team review.

**Critical:** Vale rules are not distributed to application repositories. CI fetches canonical rules from `core-akr-templates/.akr/vale-rules/` at runtime. Application teams should not maintain local AKR Vale rule copies.

### Initial `modules.yaml` Template

```yaml
# modules.yaml — TrainingTracker.Api Pilot
project:
  name: TrainingTracker.Api
  layer: API
  standards_version: v1.0.0
  minimum_standards_version: v1.0.0
  compliance_mode: pilot

# Modules section initially empty — populated by Mode A
modules: []

# Database objects section initially empty — populated by Mode A or manually
database_objects: []

# Unassigned files — populated by Mode A when files cannot be confidently grouped
unassigned: []
```

### Hosted MCP Context Source Configuration

**If Test 2 passed (Pre-pilot):**

1. Open VS Code Settings → Copilot → MCP
2. Add `core-akr-templates` repository as context source
3. Verify condensed charter loads on new session
4. Test in Visual Studio as well

**If Test 2 failed (Pre-pilot fallback):**

1. Copy the **condensed backend charter** to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (must be ≤ **2,500 tokens**; enforced by our tokenizer check)
2. Document: this is per-repository distribution until hosted MCP available
3. Future migration path: when hosted MCP becomes available, remove from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complete onboarding checklist | Pilot dev | All 10 items checked | 3 hours |
| Document onboarding friction points | Pilot dev | Notes on unclear steps or missing instructions | 30 min |
| Validate tooling end-to-end | Standards author | Agent Skill loads; CI triggers; Vale runs | 1 hour |
| Schedule Mode A session | Standards author + pilot dev | 1-hour pairing session on calendar | 5 min |

---

## Deliverable 2: Mode A — Grouping Proposal

### Objective

Run Agent Skill Mode A to propose module groupings; developer validates and approves in ≤15 minutes.

### Invocation

**In VS Code Copilot Chat:**
```
@workspace propose module groupings for TrainingTracker.Api
```

**Or GitHub Copilot CLI:**
```bash
gh copilot suggest "propose module groupings for TrainingTracker.Api"
```

### Expected Output - Draft manifest review followed by PR

**Step 1 - Draft modules.yaml (immediate, before PR):**
`modules.yaml` is written as the draft grouping manifest and summarized in Copilot Chat.
There is no separate Mode A review-sheet artifact.
The developer validates this file directly in VS Code - not a GitHub PR diff.
This file is the permanent approval surface and the starting context for all future Mode A incremental updates.

**Step 2 - Final modules.yaml + PR (after direct manifest approval):**
Developer and tech lead make any necessary edits directly in `modules.yaml`; module statuses reflect the final human assessment.
PR opened with `modules.yaml` as the grouping source of truth.
CI validates modules.yaml schema, enum values, and businessCapability tags.

### Developer Validation Tasks - Using modules.yaml Directly

| Validation | Where to Do It | What to Check | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Semantic accuracy** | `modules.yaml` in VS Code | Does each file's assigned role match what it actually does? | 3 min |
| **Module naming** | `modules.yaml`, module entry | Do module names reflect domain language, not file names? | 2 min |
| **File count** | `modules.yaml`, module entry | Any module over limit? Record split recommendation directly in the manifest update. | 1 min |
| **Misplaced files** | `modules.yaml`, module_files arrays | Move files to the correct module entry or to `unassigned[]` as needed. | 3 min |
| **Unassigned rationale** | `modules.yaml`, `unassigned[]` | Is each reason correct? | 2 min |
| **Business capability tags** | `modules.yaml`, module entries | Does each `businessCapability` value exist in `tag-registry.json`? | 2 min |
| **Reply to agent** | Copilot Chat | Reply 'approved' or 'N reassignments made'. | 1 min |

**Total validation time target: ≤15 minutes**
**Note:** Review is done in VS Code, not GitHub. The PR is a merge/CI artifact - all semantic decisions are made before it opens.

### Mode A PR Checklist (Auto-Generated by Agent Skill)

```markdown
## Mode A — Grouping Proposal Review

- [ ] All module groupings reviewed for semantic accuracy
- [ ] Module names reflect domain language (not file names)
- [ ] No module exceeds 8 files
- [ ] Misplaced files reassigned to correct module
- [ ] Shared/infrastructure files correctly placed in unassigned[]
- [ ] All database objects identified and typed correctly
- [ ] Approved modules are marked with `grouping_status: approved`
- [ ] modules.yaml grouping approval completed before documentation generation begins
- [ ] Document front matter status is reviewed as a separate content-maturity decision and is not assumed from modules.yaml approval
```

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoke Mode A | Pilot dev | Agent generates draft `modules.yaml` and displays grouping summary in chat | 5 min (agent) |
| Review and validate groupings | Pilot dev | `modules.yaml` edits complete; manifest edit count recorded | 15 min |
| Confirm to agent | Pilot dev | Reply 'approved' or 'N reassignments' | 1 min |
| Agent preserves reviewed manifest and opens PR | Agent | modules.yaml preserved with human edits and statuses; PR opened | 3 min (agent) |
| Tech lead spot-check | Tech lead | Confirms modules.yaml reflects final assessment; approves | 3 min |
| Record validation time | Standards author | Time from modules.yaml review start → agent reply vs. 15 min target; recorded in AKR_Tracking.md | 2 min |

### Success Metrics

- **Grouping accuracy:** ≥90% of proposed groupings accepted without reassignment
- **Validation time:** ≤15 minutes from modules.yaml review start to developer reply
- **Friction score:** Developer completes review in VS Code without opening GitHub
- **Reassignment churn:** Zero PR comments requesting reassignment
- **Future update speed:** Second Mode A invocation (after code change) completes in ≤5 min

## Deliverable 3: Mode B — Documentation Generation

### Objective

Run Agent Skill Mode B to generate documentation for CourseDomain module; developer reviews and fills `❓` sections.

### Reusable Section Guidance Block Reference

Use the draft section-guidance standard at:
`docs/implementation_plans/SECTION_GUIDANCE_BLOCK_DRAFT.md`

Phase 2 application scope:
- Apply the TL;DR guidance block in pilot module template runs so TL;DR output remains business-readable for Product Owner and QA audiences.
- Collect reviewer feedback on clarity and usefulness during Deliverable 7 retrospective inputs.
- Promote to normalized template pattern only after pilot validation confirms value and low context overhead.

### Invocation

**In VS Code Copilot Chat:**
```
@workspace generate documentation for CourseDomain module
```

### Expected Output - Two committed artifacts, in sequence

**Step 1 - Committed draft (immediate, before PR):**
`docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` written and committed to the branch.
Displayed in Copilot Chat with validation summary block.
Developer edits draft in VS Code Markdown Preview.
This file is a permanent artifact and the starting context for all future Mode B incremental updates.

**Step 2 - Final doc_output + PR (after developer confirms):**
Final `docs/modules/{ModuleName}_doc.md` written from the confirmed draft.
Draft-only front matter fields stripped; final-doc front matter injected (Step 6a).
For first-generation output, final-doc front matter status remains `draft` unless document-content approval has already been explicitly completed and recorded.
PR opened with validation summary block in PR description.
PR body notes: "Pre-commit draft reviewed at docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md before PR open."
CI validates final file. modules.yaml updated with draft_output, last_reviewed_at, review_mode.
`modules.yaml` approval remains the grouping-control record; it is not the document approval record.

### Developer Content Review Tasks - Using the Committed Draft

| Review | Where to Do It | What to Fill/Validate | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Read validation summary** | Copilot Chat | Check section completeness, ❓ count, validator result. If errors: ask agent to fix. | 2 min |
| **❓ sections** | `docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md` in VS Code Markdown Preview | Fill ❓ sections or add `DEFERRED: [reason]` with owner. | 10 min |
| **Business Rules** | Draft file | Confirm "Why It Exists" accuracy; add "Since When" dates. | 5 min |
| **Data Operations** | Draft file | Verify all reads and writes covered. | 5 min |
| **Architecture diagram** | Draft file | Validate full stack is correct. | 2 min |
| **Operations Map** | Draft file | Spot-check all public methods listed. | 3 min |
| **Reply to agent** | Copilot Chat | Reply 'ready to commit'. | 1 min |

**Total content review time target: ≤30 minutes**
**Note:** Review is done in VS Code. The draft file is both the review surface and the permanent record of the developer's annotations. This review governs document maturity. It is distinct from the earlier Mode A review that governed module grouping correctness.

### Mode B PR Checklist (Auto-Generated by Agent Skill)

```markdown
## Mode B — CourseDomain Documentation Review

- [ ] Module Files section lists all files with correct roles
- [ ] All ❓ sections reviewed; filled or marked DEFERRED with justification
- [ ] Business Rules table complete including "Why It Exists" column
- [ ] Data Operations section covers all reads and writes
- [ ] Questions & Gaps populated with open items
- [ ] validate_documentation.py passes with zero errors
- [ ] CODEOWNERS notified for review
```

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Invoke Mode B for CourseDomain | Pilot dev | Agent generates draft documentation | 10 min (agent time) |
| Apply reusable TL;DR section guidance block in draft review | Pilot dev | TL;DR section aligns with `SECTION_GUIDANCE_BLOCK_DRAFT.md` and is readable by non-implementing stakeholders | 5 min |
| Review and fill content | Pilot dev | All checklist items completed | 30 min |
| Run `validate_documentation.py` locally | Pilot dev | Zero errors; all required sections present | 5 min |
| Open Mode B PR | Pilot dev | Draft PR with completed checklist | 5 min |

| Record generation time | Standards author | Actual time vs. 30 min target documented | 2 min |
| Record section-guidance feedback | Standards author | Feedback captured for TL;DR clarity and recommendation status for template normalization | 3 min |

### Incremental Update Procedure (subsequent Mode B runs after code changes)

Invocation: `@workspace update {ModuleName} documentation for recent changes to [file(s)]`

Agent behavior:
- Reads committed draft at docs/modules/.akr/{ModuleName}_draft.md (primary context)
- Does not re-read all files or re-run full SSG unless patch scope expands beyond identified changed files
- Reads only changed source file(s); loads only relevant charter section(s)
- Patches affected sections in-place; updates front matter timestamps
- Displays incremental summary (patched vs. unchanged sections; new ❓ markers)
- Developer confirms; agent strips draft-only front matter, writes final doc, opens PR

Target time: ≤10 minutes (developer time)

### SSG Timing Data Collection

During Mode B runs in the pilot, the following data must be recorded for every module documented. This feeds `benchmark.json`, the strategy decision benchmark table, and quota planning guidance.

Collection method: Timing and strategy fields are read from the `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header in each PR output. Premium requests are read from the GitHub billing dashboard Copilot usage view (per-session or per-day export, matched to documentation PR timestamps). Quality metrics are derived from the validator output and a manual spot-check.

| Module | Files | LOC Est. | Strategy | Premium Requests | Total Time (s) | Pass 2 Split? | Sections Present | ❓ Marker Count | Ops Map Complete (%) | Validator Pass? | Mode C Time (min) | CQS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [CourseDomain] | 5 | ~800 | SSG | | | No | | | | | | |
| [EnrollmentDomain] | | | SSG | | | | | | | | | |
| [UserDomain] | | | SSG | | | | | | | | | |
| [SmallModule] | <=3 | <600 | Single-pass | | | N/A | | | | | | |

Notes on collection:
- "Ops Map Complete (%)" requires a 5-minute manual spot-check: open the source file, count public methods, compare to Operations Map entries. Record as a rough percentage (not exact).
- "Mode C Time" is recorded by the developer using a stopwatch during their ❓ review session, starting when Mode C is invoked and ending when all items are resolved or DEFERRED.
- Premium requests: if the billing dashboard does not provide per-module granularity, record the session-level count and note the session included this module only.
- CQS is calculated post-collection using the formula in Part 18.6.3. Standards author calculates after all other fields are populated.

After at least 3 SSG modules and 1 single-pass module are documented, calculate:
- Average premium requests per strategy per module profile
- Average CQS per strategy per module profile
- Record in `benchmark.json` under the `ssg` -> `premium-requests` and `quality` keys
- Record in `benchmark.json` -> `quota-planning` block

### Success Metrics

- **Section completeness:** 100% required sections present (validated in draft before PR)
- **Content review time (first-run):** ≤30 minutes from draft display to 'ready to commit'
- **Incremental update time:** ≤10 minutes from invocation to developer confirmation
- **Validation pass rate:** Zero validator errors on PR open
- **❓ fill rate:** ≥95% of ❓ sections filled or marked DEFERRED
- **PR comment volume:** Zero tech lead comments requesting content changes
- **Friction score:** Developer does not open GitHub to complete content review

### Slow Module Escalation

If a module's total generation time exceeds 45 minutes during the pilot, follow this process:

1. Record the event. Log to `.akr/logs/session-*.jsonl` (via `agentStop` hook). Note which pass was slowest and approximately how many source file tokens were loaded in Pass 2.
2. Do not re-run immediately. Re-running the same configuration will produce the same timing result. First evaluate whether module splitting is appropriate.
3. Evaluate module splitting. If the module has 7-8 files and large file sizes, splitting into two sub-modules (<=5 files each) is the preferred resolution. This requires a modules.yaml update (PR through standards team) and a Mode A re-validation step.
4. If splitting is not feasible (e.g., the files are tightly coupled and cannot be logically separated), document the module as a "large module exception" in modules.yaml with `notes: "SSG slow module - single-pass fallback authorized"` and proceed with single-pass fallback. Expect additional ❓ markers.
5. Report in retrospective. Include the module name, total time, slowest pass, and resolution chosen. This feeds the `ssg-slow-module-rate` metric in `benchmark.json`.

---

## Deliverable 4: CI Validation Testing

### Objective

Verify that CI workflow runs successfully on Mode B PR; catches validation errors; provides actionable feedback.

### Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| **Happy path:** All sections present, no `❓` | Workflow passes; PR checks green | CI status: ✅ |
| **Missing section:** Operations Map omitted | Workflow fails; error message identifies missing section | CI status: ❌ with clear error |
| **Unresolved `❓` in pilot mode** | Workflow warns but passes (compliance_mode: pilot) | CI status: ⚠️ with warning |
| **File not in modules.yaml** | Workflow warns doc not registered; applies generic rules | CI status: ⚠️ |
| **Vale prose quality issue** | Vale reports style violations; does not block merge | CI status: ⚠️ |

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Test happy path scenario | Pilot dev | PR checks pass; no false positives | 30 min |
| Test missing section scenario | Pilot dev | Error message clear; identifies specific missing section | 30 min |
| Test unresolved `❓` in pilot mode | Pilot dev | Warning displayed; PR not blocked | 15 min |
| Test Vale prose check | Pilot dev | Vale runs; reports style issues; does not block | 15 min |
| Document CI feedback clarity | Standards author | Errors are actionable; no developer confusion | 30 min |

### Success Metrics

- **Zero false positives:** CI does not report errors on valid module docs
- **Error clarity:** All error messages identify specific issue and line number
- **Performance:** CI completes in <2 minutes for typical PR

---

## Deliverable 5: Visual Studio Testing

### Objective

Validate that workflow functions correctly in Visual Studio (not just VS Code).

**Why critical:** Enterprise teams may use Visual Studio for .NET projects; VS Code-only workflows create adoption friction.

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Configure Agent Skill in Visual Studio | Pilot dev | Skill loads in Copilot Chat window OR fallback documented | 30 min |
| Run Mode A in Visual Studio | Pilot dev | Grouping proposal generated successfully OR fallback documented | 30 min |
| Run Mode B in Visual Studio | Pilot dev | Documentation generated successfully OR fallback documented | 30 min |
| Document Visual Studio-specific steps | Standards author | README includes VS-specific configuration AND fallback workflow | 2 hours |
| Verify `@github` MCP tool call availability in Visual Studio Copilot Chat | Pilot dev | `@github get files with names like CHARTER.md` returns charter files OR limitation documented; VS parity vs VS Code recorded before Mode A/B VS runs begin | 15 min |

### Visual Studio Considerations

- **Skill loading:** May require different `.github/` path configuration
- **Copilot Chat integration:** UI differs from VS Code; document invocation patterns
- **MCP context source:** Confirm hosted MCP works in VS (if Test 2 passed). Also verify `@github` tool call availability: run `@github get files with names like CHARTER.md` in VS Copilot Chat. If `@github` is unavailable in VS, PATH B (local file fallback) in SKILL.md Mode B Step 2 applies for all VS sessions.
- **Terminal commands:** `validate_documentation.py` runs from Developer PowerShell
- **Fallback plan:** If Agent Skills are unavailable in VS, document workaround using VS Code for Mode A/B invocations + VS for code editing + CI validation

---

## Deliverable 6: Independent Module Documentation

### Objective

Developer documents two additional modules independently (unassisted) to validate that workflow is self-service.

### Modules

- **EnrollmentDomain** (5 files)
- **UserDomain** (4 files)

### Success Criteria

- Developer completes both modules without asking for help
- Each module takes ≤45 minutes (Mode B invocation + content review + PR)
- CI validation passes on first PR for both
- Developer reports: "Faster than writing docs manually"

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Document EnrollmentDomain | Pilot dev (unassisted) | PR opened with all sections complete | 45 min |
| Document UserDomain | Pilot dev (unassisted) | PR opened with all sections complete | 45 min |
| Record time per module | Pilot dev | Self-reported time tracked | 2 min each |
| Collect friction points | Pilot dev | Notes on unclear steps or errors encountered | 10 min |

---

## Deliverable 7: 2-4 Week Pilot Period

### Objective

Run pilot for 2-4 weeks to accumulate real-world usage data; iterate on templates and validator based on findings.

### Pilot Activities

**Week 1:**
- Mode A + Mode B for 3 modules (CourseDomain, EnrollmentDomain, UserDomain)
- Daily check-in: standards author available for questions
- Collect: time-to-doc, ❓ fill rate, validation pass rate

**Week 2:**
- Document 2 additional modules independently
- First production use: real feature development uses docs
- Collect: developer satisfaction feedback

**Week 3-4 (if needed):**
- Iterate on templates based on Week 1-2 findings
- Test updated templates on 1-2 modules
- Collect: improvement delta

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Collection Method | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Time-to-doc per module** | Self-reported by developer | ≤30 minutes |
| **Grouping validation time** | Timer during Mode A review | ≤15 minutes |
| **❓ section fill rate** | Count unresolved `❓` in merged docs | ≥95% filled or DEFERRED |
| **Validation pass rate on first PR** | CI logs | ≥95% pass without errors |
| **Grouping proposal accuracy** | % of groups needing reassignment | ≥90% accepted as-is |
| **Developer satisfaction** | Post-pilot survey | "Faster than manual" consensus |
| **Self-reporting block present rate** | Manual spot-check of Copilot Chat responses | 100% of skill responses begin with `✅ akr-docs INVOKED` block |
| **`<!-- akr-generated -->` header present rate** | `grep` over merged module docs | 100% of merged module docs contain metadata header |

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Conduct daily check-ins (Week 1) | Standards author | Developer questions answered same-day | 30 min/day |
| Collect metrics | Standards author | Spreadsheet with all metrics tracked | Ongoing |
| Identify friction points | Standards author | List of unclear steps or errors | Ongoing |
| Iterate templates (if needed) | Standards author | Updates deployed mid-pilot | 1-2 days |
| Document iteration rationale | Standards author | CHANGELOG entries for mid-pilot updates | 1 hour |

---

## Deliverable 8: Pilot Retrospective

### Objective

Conduct retrospective with quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback; decide on v1.1 updates.

### Retrospective Agenda

1. **Metrics review:** Present all tracked metrics vs. targets
2. **Friction points:** What took longer than expected? What was confusing?
3. **Template accuracy:** Did templates capture the right information?
4. **Validator effectiveness:** Did CI catch real errors? Any false positives?
5. **Developer experience:** Was workflow faster than manual documentation?
6. **Visual Studio parity:** Did VS workflow work as well as VS Code?
7. **Phase 2.5 readiness:** Do metrics support expanding to coding agent?
8. **Skill reliability:** Was the self-reporting block present in 100% of sessions? If not, when was it absent - and did the metadata header check in CI catch the gap?
9. **Model compatibility:** Did any GPT-4o-specific failure modes emerge (e.g., Mode B truncation on large modules)? Document specific module/file-count where truncation first occurred, if any.
10. **Review surface effectiveness:** Did direct `modules.yaml` review reduce reassignment PR comments to zero? Did committed drafts eliminate first-run CI failures? Were developers able to complete reviews without opening GitHub?
11. **Incremental update scenario:** Were any committed drafts used as starting context for an update-scenario Mode B run? Was the incremental path faster than full re-generation?
12. **Staleness management:** Were any committed drafts found stale relative to code changes? How were they detected?
13. **Governance stability baseline (feeds Phase 2.6):** Record first-run CI pass rate AND Operations Map completeness rate now, before Phase 2.5. These are the baseline measurements Phase 2.6 requires.

| Validator first-pass rate - single-pass | Informational | |
| Modules documented via developer-elected single-pass | Informational (track proportion) | |
| Monthly quota consumed by documentation (% of individual quota) | <25% of monthly quota | |

- **Retrospective questions to add:**
  "For modules where generation took >20 minutes, did developers use the coding agent background execution model or wait interactively? What was the impact on developer experience?"
  "For any single-pass runs: did the Mode C resolution time offset the premium request savings? Would the developer use single-pass again for that module profile?"
  "At the current average premium request rate per module, how many modules can a developer document before exhausting their monthly quota? Is this sufficient for the team's documentation cadence?"
- **Friction point log:** Issues encountered with priority ratings
- **Template updates required:** Specific sections to add/modify/remove
- **Validator updates required:** Rules that fired false positives or missed errors
- **Onboarding checklist refinement:** Steps that were unclear or redundant
- **v1.1.0 scope:** Features to include in next minor release
- **Phase 2.5 authorization:** Go/no-go for coding agent spike
- **Skill reliability report:** Self-reporting block presence rate + metadata header presence rate across all pilot Mode B sessions; root cause noted for any absence events
- **`SKILL-COMPAT.md` v1.1 update:** GPT-4o failure modes observed during pilot (if any) documented before Phase 2.5 begins; pass rates in `benchmark.json` updated with pilot real-world data
- `preview-friction-score`: % of reviews completed in-editor without opening GitHub (target: ≥80%)
- `reassignment-churn-rate`: avg PR comments requesting reassignment (target: 0 after first two modules)

## Deliverable 9: Onboarding Checklist Finalization

### Objective

Finalize onboarding checklist based on pilot learnings; prepare for second project rollout.

### Checklist Refinements

- **Step ordering:** Was sequence logical? Any prerequisite missed?
- **Clarity:** Were instructions clear? Any ambiguous steps?
- **Tooling:** Did all configuration steps work? Any platform-specific issues?
- **Timing:** Were time estimates accurate? Any steps take longer than expected?

### Finalized Checklist Template

```markdown
# AKR Documentation Onboarding Checklist

## Prerequisites
- [ ] GitHub Copilot Business or Enterprise license confirmed
- [ ] Project identified and team assigned
- [ ] core-akr-templates v1.0.0+ available

## Setup (estimated: 2 hours)
- [ ] **[MIGRATION ONLY]** Remove `.akr/templates` git submodule if repo was onboarded under old submodule model: `git submodule deinit -f .akr/templates` → `git rm .akr/templates` → `rm -rf .git/modules/.akr/templates` → remove `.gitmodules`
- [ ] Configure hosted MCP context source (or .github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [ ] Run `distribute-skill.yml` workflow for this repo; confirm SKILL.md, mode scripts, `akr_inline_validate.py`, and `validate_documentation.py` are present under `.github/skills/akr-docs/scripts/`; verify `SKILL_VERSION` header
- [ ] Confirm `.github/hooks/postToolUse.json` and `.github/hooks/agentStop.json` present (distributed with SKILL.md); run Mode B session to verify `.akr/logs/` is created
- [ ] Deploy validate-documentation.yml workflow
- [ ] Create initial modules.yaml (project section only)
- [ ] Test CI workflow on draft PR
- [ ] Create CODEOWNERS file

## Skill Distribution Registration (estimated: 30 min)
- [ ] Confirm `SKILL_VERSION` header in .github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md
- [ ] Add .github/skills/akr-docs/SKILL.md to CODEOWNERS: @org/standards-team
- [ ] Standards author adds repo to registered-repos.yaml in core-akr-templates
- [ ] Test distribution workflow: workflow_dispatch targeting this repo opens a PR
- [ ] Merge test PR to confirm end-to-end flow works

## Mode A — Grouping Proposal (estimated: 1 hour)
- [ ] Invoke Agent Skill Mode A: "propose module groupings"
- [ ] Review draft modules.yaml (15 minutes)
- [ ] Validate groupings per checklist
- [ ] Open Mode A PR
- [ ] Tech lead approves groupings

## Mode B — Documentation Generation (per module, estimated: 45 minutes)
- [ ] Invoke Agent Skill Mode B: "generate documentation for [Module]"
- [ ] Review and fill ❓ sections (30 minutes)
- [ ] Run validate_documentation.py locally
- [ ] Open Mode B PR
- [ ] CI validation passes
- [ ] Tech lead approves content

## Pilot Period (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Document 3+ modules independently
- [ ] Collect metrics (time, pass rate, satisfaction)
- [ ] Identify friction points
- [ ] Iterate templates if needed

## Retrospective
- [ ] Conduct pilot retrospective
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update onboarding checklist for next project
```

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Incorporate pilot feedback | Standards author | Checklist updated with clarifications | 2 hours |
| Validate time estimates | Standards author | All estimates reflect pilot actuals | 30 min |
| Add platform-specific notes | Standards author | Windows/macOS/Linux considerations documented | 1 hour |

## Deliverable 10: Second Project Onboarding

### Objective

Validate that updated onboarding checklist works on a second project; prove repeatability.

### Second Project Selection

**Criteria:**
- Different `project.layer` than pilot (if pilot was API, choose UI or Database)
- Different team (validates knowledge transfer)
- Active development (real documentation needs)

**Recommended:** UI project using React/TypeScript to test `ui-component` workflow

### Success Criteria

- Onboarding completed in ≤4 hours using finalized checklist
- Zero questions that should have been answered by checklist
- Mode A + Mode B workflows successful on first attempt
- Developer reports: "Checklist was clear and complete"

### Tasks

| Task | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Select second project | Standards lead | Project identified; team assigned | External |
| Run onboarding using finalized checklist | Second project dev | All steps completed | 4 hours |
| Document any missing steps | Second project dev | Feedback provided to standards team | 30 min |
| Update checklist (if needed) | Standards author | Final refinements incorporated | 1 hour |

## Phase 2 Retrospective

### Retrospective Agenda

1. **Pilot success:** Did metrics meet targets? What exceeded expectations?
2. **Onboarding effectiveness:** Was checklist complete? Any missing steps?
3. **Template accuracy:** Did module groupings produce correct documentation?
4. **Validator effectiveness:** Did CI catch real errors? Any false positives?
5. **Developer adoption:** Is team excited about workflow? Any resistance?
6. **Visual Studio parity:** Was VS experience equivalent to VS Code?
7. **Phase 2.5 decision:** Should we proceed with coding agent spike?

### Retrospective Outputs

- **Phase 2 completion metrics:** Pilot vs. second project comparison
- **Deterministic timing metrics:** Event-derived grouping validation time and time-to-doc from PR/CI timestamps
- **v1.1.0 backlog:** Features deferred or identified during pilot
- **Onboarding playbook:** Final checklist + lessons learned
- **Phase 2.5 authorization:** Standards lead go/no-go decision
- **`benchmark.json` update:** Real-world pilot pass rates added alongside Phase 1 synthetic baseline; delta between synthetic and real-world documented if significant

## Risk Register (Phase 2 Specific)

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pilot developer unavailable mid-pilot | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 Low | Assign backup developer before pilot begins |
| Mode A groups files incorrectly | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Medium | 15-minute validation catches; developer reassigns |
| CI false positives frustrate team | 🔴 High | 🟠 Low | Monitor false positive rate; hot-fix validator if >5% |
| Visual Studio workflow broken | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 Low | Phase 0 Test 6 baseline passed; pilot validates real project integration; document workarounds if issues found |
| Pilot metrics don't support Phase 2.5 | 🟡 Medium | 🟠 Low | Retrospective determines if manual workflow sufficient |

---

## Success Criteria Summary

Phase 2 succeeds when:

✅ Pilot project onboarding complete (3 hours)  
✅ Mode A grouping validated in ≤15 minutes  
✅ Mode B documentation for 3 modules in ≤30 minutes each  
✅ First documented PR CI validation passes  
✅ Visual Studio workflow tested and documented  
✅ Two additional modules documented independently  
✅ 2-4 week pilot period completed with metrics  
✅ Pilot retrospective conducted; lessons documented  
✅ Onboarding checklist finalized  
✅ Second project onboarded successfully  
✅ Self-reporting block present in 100% of observed pilot Mode B sessions (or absence events documented with root cause)  
✅ `<!-- akr-generated -->` metadata header present in 100% of merged module docs (validated by CI)  

**Exit gate:** Phase 2 retrospective complete; Phase 2.5 authorized by standards lead **in writing** (GitHub comment, email, or approval record) before Phase 2.5 begins.
